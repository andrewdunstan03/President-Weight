007: Everything or Nothing|James Bond 007: Everything or NothingJP,Yes,"November 17, 2003NA , PAL 2004JP",Griptonite Games,"EA GamesNA, PAL / Electronic ArtsJP","NA, PAL, JP","The game opens in Tajikistan, where MI6 agent James Bond infiltrates a stronghold where an organization sells a stolen Soviet suitcase bomb.  Bond triggers a firefight between the two factions making the exchange, using the confusion to steal the device and escape.
The disappearance of Oxford scientist Dr. Katya Nadanova (Heidi Klum), who oversees a top-secret nanotechnology humanitarian project, leads 007 to a weapons research facility in the Sahara, where he is ordered to rescue Nadanova and prevent the theft of the nanobot prototypes. Destroying the facility, Bond follows the kidnappers onto an armored train where he encounters and dispatches Jaws (using the likeness of Richard Kiel). Bond discovers Nadanova and rescues her before pursuing the terrorist via helicopter through the Valley of the Kings. Bond defeats the terrorist and takes Nadanova to her safehouse, where it is revealed that she is working in conjunction with Nikolai Diavolo (Willem Dafoe), a former KGB agent whose mentor and friend was Max Zorin (the primary antagonist of the 1985 film A View to a Kill). The two intend to re-purpose the nanobots for far sinister purposes than their original intention of repairing nuclear reactors. 
Upon returning to MI6, M (Judi Dench) informs Bond of the disappearance of another 00 agent, Jack Mason, alias 003, who was last seen investigating a platinum mine in Peru. Bond is sent there to track down Mason's last known contact Serena St. Germaine (Shannon Elizabeth), an American geologist who may have a clue to his whereabouts. Serena takes Bond to a mining complex where he discovers Mason is being tortured by Diavolo. Before succumbing to his wounds, Mason informs Bond that Diavolo intends to move his operations to New Orleans. Bond learns of Nadanova's ties with Diavolo when she captures Serena and throws her out of a helicopter. Bond dives off a cliff to rescue her through the use of Q's (John Cleese) rappel gadget and the two escape Diavolo's mercenaries via tank. 
Searching New Orleans, Bond learns that Diavolo has enlisted a war criminal named Arkady Yayakov to help re-purpose the nanobots. Bond infiltrates a factory owned by Diavolo and uncovers a lead pointing to a local nightclub owned by Yayakov, where he crosses paths with Mya Starling (MÃ½a), an NSA field operative who is also investigating Diavolo. However, Starling's cover is blown and she is held by Yayakov in a 19th century graveyard. Bond rescues Starling and dispatches of Yayakov's remaining men. 
007 tracks Diavolo's operations to an abandoned plantation in Louisiana, where he discovers he has altered Nadanova's nanobots to eat through all metals but platinum, disintegrating everything they come in contact with. Destroying the laboratory and killing Yayakov, Bond finds a tanker of nanobots which is being driven by Jaws to the levees of New Orleans with the intent of flooding the city. Bond destroys the truck before it can reach the levees, and returns to Peru to further investigate Diavolo's platinum mines.
After winning a rally race hosted by Diavolo, Bond finds he has captured Serena, allowing Diavolo to escape to the mines. After saving Serena, Bond reaches the mines, but is captured by Nadanova. Diavolo explains that he intends to use the nanobots to destroy the Kremlin and use his army of tanks, armored with platinum to make them immune to the nanobots, to control Russia, and then overthrow Europe. Tied in the path of a mining drill, Bond escapes his shackles and flees the mines in a helicopter piloted by Serena.
Following Diavolo to Moscow, Bond steals one of Diavolo's platinum tanks and uses it to prevent the release of the nanobots in Red Square and heads for a missile silo hidden under the Kremlin. Bond kills Jaws and deactivates the nanotech missiles. Diavolo and Nadanova then pursue Bond with a soviet fighter jet. Bond destroys the jet and Nadanova is killed, although Diavolo ejects just in time. Diavolo reaches a control tower, reactivating one of the missiles and targeting it at London. Bond destroys the control tower, where Diavolo launches the missile before falling to his death into the silo. Destroying the missile as it launches, Bond prevents the catastrophe and reunites with Serena outside the Kremlin.
","The gameplay is a mix of third-person shooting/action sequences and vehicle sequences. In third-person missions, Bond can typically use cover, engage in hand-to-hand combat, use gadgets and perform some context-sensitive actions, while driving sequences primarily involve racing to a specific objective.

007: Nightfire,Yes (VS),2003,JV Games Inc.,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL","British MI6 agent James Bond works alongside French Intelligence operative Dominique Paradis to prevent the use of a stolen nuclear weapon within the city of Paris by a terrorist group during New Year's Eve. The pair manage to thwart the terrorists and prevent the device from being detonated before Bond and Dominique spend the evening celebrating the new year. Shortly after returning, Bond's boss M reveals news that a missile guidance chip, intended for the Space Defense Platform (SDP) - a new militarized space station built by the United States - has been stolen. MI6 suspects the theft is linked to Phoenix International, a company owned by industrialist Raphael Drake - and that the head of Drake's Asian division, Alexander Mayhew, is due to bring the chip to him during a party at his castle in Austria.
M sends Bond to recover the chip during the exchange and investigate Drake's motive for its acquisition. Infiltrating the party, Bond meets with CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, his contact sent to assist in the chip's recovery, but is surprised to find Dominique within the castle, learning that she is working undercover as Drake's mistress. After reaching the meeting room where Drake and Mayhew intend to meet, Bond overhears the men discussing a project codenamed ""Nightfire"" before discovering that Zoe had been captured. Bond recovers the chip before going after and rescuing Zoe, whereupon the pair make their way down the mountain for a rendezvous with Q, dealing with Drake's men and his Head of Security, Armitage Rook. Following the incident, Mayhew contacts MI6 to offer information on Drake's operations in exchange for protection.
Bond is sent to Japan to extract Mayhew at his Japanese estate, but shortly after being introduced to his bodyguard Kiko, Drake's men attack the building. While Mayhew is killed, Bond finds important information that leads him to Phoenix's Tokyo offices and a nuclear power plant being decommissioned. After gathering evidence, Kiko turns on Bond and brings him to Drake, who exposes Dominique as a spy for helping Bond escape his security teams and has her executed. Before he is killed himself, Bond breaks free and escapes to the ground floor, where he is rescued by Australian Intelligence agent Alura McCall. Upon leaving Tokyo, Bond finds himself sent to an island in the South Pacific alongside Alura, learning that Drake owns it and using a jamming signal to conceal what he has stationed there.
Sent ahead of a joint taskforce of UN, EU and NATO forces, Bond and Alura deal with the island's defenses, while eliminating Rook and Kiko. Discovering that Drake built a launch facility on the island, Bond determines that he plans to capture the SDP and use its weapons to dominate the world. While Alura remains behind, Bond pursues after Drake in one of his space shuttles. Reaching the station, he proceeds to sabotage it so that it destroys itself, before killing Drake as it begins to break apart. Bond swiftly escapes in an escape pod moments before the station is destroyed and returns to the planet. Upon his return, Bond reunites with Alura and spends a romantic evening to celebrate another successful mission.
","Nightfire features two game modes for use - a single-player mode featuring a variety of missions and focused on the game's story, and a multiplayer mode where players can engage with other players, as well as AI bots. The game operates from a first-person perspective and features a variety of weapons all based on real-life models, but, much like previous games involving James Bond, have alternate names. The game features a similar arrangement to monitoring health as with GoldenEye 007, in that players have a health meter that decrease when they take damage, with the player's character killed when its fully depleted, though armor can be acquired to absorb the damage during gameplay.
In the single-player mode, players must complete a set of objectives, which requires navigating around each mission's level dealing with hostiles and making use of gadgets. Completing a level is done by completing all objectives and reaching the level's exit goal. Each level has a number of unique tokens, referred to as ""007 tokens"", which unlock special rewards in the game, and are acquired by completing certain actions in a level. At times, the player also engages in driving sections during certain levels - these stages function in a similar style to those used in the Spy Hunter series of video games, in which the player uses offensive weapons and gadgets to deal with enemies, while following a linear A-to-B route from the start to the finish of the level. Completing a level allows the player to receive a score that denotes how well they performed.
Multiplayer mode focuses on players battling with each other and AI bots across a variety of stages - while some stages are based on levels from the game, others are based on settings and fictional locations based from the James Bond film franchise, including Fort Knox, from Goldfinger (1964), and Atlantis from The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Players can choose which characters to play as, including a selection taken from the film franchise such as Jaws, Baron Samedi, Max Zorin, Auric Goldfinger, and Renard. Players can customize settings before a match, such as length of play, conditions for winning and so forth, as well as the setting for any AI bots used in the match - alongside players, bots can be used (four for PlayStation 2, and six for GameCube and Xbox), which can be customized with different reaction times, speed and health.
Computer versions of the game function similar to the console versions, though with some differences:

A Sound of Thunder,"Yes (COOP, SPM)",2004PAL 2005NA,MÃ¶bius Entertainment,"BAM! Entertainment, Inc. / Franchise Interactive","NA, PAL","The game mostly follows the plot of the film and retains some of the characters. Travis Ryer is a guide and biologist for Time Safari Inc. (TSI), a company which provides time-travel hunting safaris for the rich. After a time tourist alters the course of events in the late Cretaceous, the future begins to change as ""time waves"" bring further consequences due to the butterfly's absence from the course of history. Dinosaur-like creatures soon run rampant, and the world becomes progressively overgrown with tropical vegetation.
Travis learns from Dr. Sonia Rand, inventor of the time machine, that a butterfly was brought back from the past on the last safari. He tries going back to reset the timeline, but is turned back by a ""cleanup crew"" from TSI. The crew disappears, however, due to the changes in history. Ryer gets in contact with one of the tourists, Ted Eckles (spelled Eckels in the film), who informs him it was his friend Christian Middleton who was responsible. On the way to Middleton's place, Eckles is killed as a time wave arrives. Middleton is discovered dead, but Ryer manages to retrieve the butterfly, get back to TSI and enter the time machine. Right afterwards, a time wave arrives and gets rid of the vegetation and animals, implying the timeline was set right.
","The game is an overhead shooter, played from an isometric perspective. The objective is to complete each mission by killing mutants, solving push-the-crate puzzles and completing the occasional driving stage until the end of the level is reached. Along the way, the player can earn points for collecting items, killing enemies, completing the level within a certain time and exploring all the rooms. The player can resume progress via a six-letter password-based save, which does not, however, retain the player's scores.
The game provides an array of collectible weapons, which automatically lock onto enemies. One of them, the Time Freeze Disruptor, can slow down the player's surroundings while allowing the player to move at regular speed (similar to bullet time). Most weapons rely on collectible ammo, but the electric prod only needs to be charged by holding down the fire button before use.
The game can be played alone or in co-op via Link Cable. The Link Cable also allows for a single-cartridge deathmatch with up to four players in a special arena.

Advance Guardian Heroes,Yes (COOP),2004,Treasure Co. Ltd,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL, JP","The story follows the events of Guardian Heroes. After the Undead Hero was returned to his rest, the heroes were given the option of becoming the Sky Spirit's perfect warriors. The group was divided, with Nicole, Serena, and Valgar joining the Sky Spirit, and Han and Genjiro refusing. Randy escaped back to earth on his own, leaving Han and Genjiro to fight a losing battle against their former comrades.
Years later, Zur returns. He resurrects Kanon and uses the power of the Guardian Heroes to take over the world. The few remaining resistance forces call upon the power of the Undead Hero once again, with one young soldier giving up his body to serve as its vessel.
Throughout the game, the character fights the previous heroes and earns their power. Ultimately, it is revealed this is another attempt by the heavens to create the ultimate warrior. In the final battle against the ruler of the heavens, all heroes gather to defeat it and subsequently leave for the Other World.
","Advance Guardian Heroes is a side-scrolling beat 'em up[1] in which the playable characters can perform various attacks.[2] Physical moves include countering and mid-air dashes. Magic attacks, which drain the MP meter, include element spells and protective barriers. It is also possible to go into ""Hyper Mode"", a faster, more powerful version of the playable character.
The game is separated in various stages and sub-stages with their own boss-fights, enemies, and puzzles. Gameplay modes include ""Story"" for up to two players, ""Versus"" and ""Training"".
Unlike its predecessor, Advance Guardian Heroes allows players to move smoothly towards and away from the screen, as opposed to switching between 3 planes. Some platforming elements have been added to break up the combat, and two new jumping manoeuvres, the air-dash and the homing jump, have been implemented. Some sequences in which these moves are used seem to be references to various 8-bit and arcade games, and some wire-fu films.
A large part of the game relies on a revised ""barrier spell"". All playable characters (and enemies on higher difficulty settings) have the barrier spell available, and at the cost of magic-over-time, it renders a character invincible. Properly timed use of the barrier spell allows a player to reflect projectiles and magic (in a visual effect reminiscent of Mischief Makers' Marina Liteyears throwing a laser or lightning bolt back at its source), or stun enemies who attack in melee.
A green gauge is used to represent the character's anger. At any point that the player's character is rendered immobile or out of the player's control, the player can rapidly press buttons to increase the anger gauge. Points allocated to the character's mobility grant bonuses to how quickly this gauge increases. When it flashes, the character can press A+B simultaneously to activate ""Hyper Mode"" or ""Anger Mode"", starting a timer in which the anger gauge decreases, the magic gauge increases, the character is given a burst of speed, and the player is returned control of the character.
If the player's character dies during the course of the game, a sinister figure appears and offers to give the character invincibility in exchange for the character's soul. If the player refuses, the princess appears and reassures the player that there will be another chance, before the game transitions to a game over screen. If the player agrees to the sinister figure's conditions, then the character is brought back to life in a state referred to as ""Devil Mode"" that is unable to take damage (although still able to be knocked down and flung around) for the next six minutes, before the sinister figure reappears and destroys the character, resulting in a game over screen. Regardless of the player's choice, the game may be continued from the last checkpoint reached before going into ""Devil Mode"".
Also, unlike the first game, the player is allowed to use almost every unlocked character in the main story as well as in the other modes.
Throughout the game, defeated enemies will drop crystals of varying sizes and colour, that act as the experience points. Between stages, players can allocate these crystals towards one or more of their character's attributes: Vitality, Mind, Attack, Defence, Magical Attack, Magical Defence, and Mobility. At certain points, the player has to fight the heroes of the previous game, and upon defeating them, they will give up their souls, which will increase one of attributes by 10. Increasing an attribute with soul crystals will raise the character's level, no matter how high that attribute was to begin with. The higher the character's level, the more soul crystals will be needed to reach the next level, so players have to allocate their points carefully. Anything left over after allocation, can be donated towards unlocking further playable characters.

Advance Wars,Yes (SPM),2001,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"NA, PAL","The story of the Advance Wars begins in the ""Field Training"" tutorial mode, with the nation of Orange Star in a war against the neighboring nation of Blue Moon, with Olaf as the Blue Moon Army commanding officer (CO). Olaf suddenly ordered an invasion of the Orange Star nation and is in battle with the Orange Star Army. The campaign continues the story that started in the tutorial. Nell, the de facto leader of the Orange Star COs, gives the player the duty of a tactical advisor for the Orange Star Army.[2]
The player follows the war effort through all four countries, with its own COs, over the course of the game. Starting with having only one choice of a CO to advise, Andy, the player will have a choice of two more Orange Star COs, Max and Sami, to advise as the story progresses, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, there are times when a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the main path.
After winning a battle against Green Earth, Andy gets mysteriously accused by Green Earth's CO, Eagle, of committing a treacherous act of aggression against Green Earth.[3] After defeating the Blue Moon troops that invaded the Orange Star country, the Orange Star Army then invade the Blue Moon country, defeating their troops. The Blue Moon COs, Olaf and Grit, are revealed to be COs whom both used to work for the Orange Star Army, but switched to Blue Moon. When the Orange Star Army's intention was to just pass through the other two countries, Green Earth and Yellow Comet, the countries' COs like Kanbei of Yellow Comet assume a threat of an invasion and declare battles against the Orange Star Army in their land.[4]
Later on, Green Earth CO Drake tells Eagle that the Orange Star Army didn't attack Green Earth, saying that ""This entire conflict has been orchestrated from the beginning."" Meanwhile, Yellow Comet CO Sonja and Grit try to discover the person who is really behind the attacks. When Eagle meets Andy again, Eagle again accuses Andy of attacking Green Earth, to which the Orange Star COs eventually convince Eagle that it wasn't Andy who attacked Green Earth. This explains why the three nations have been declaring battles against Orange Star, as they thought Andy attacked them first.[5]
When Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja also tells Eagle that Andy wasn't behind the attacks, saying it was someone else, and goes with her to see what she discovered. It is revealed that the enigmatic Black Hole Army, under the command of Sturm, is the true enemy. Using a CO doppelganger clone of Andy, Sturm stirred up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them.[6] Once this is revealed, the four countries unite to drive Black Hole out of their land, the Cosmo Land, with COs automatically chosen depending on the paths the player took during the game.
","The objective is to defeat the enemy army. There are two ways to defeat an opponent: destroy every one of the opponent's units on the map or capture the opponent's headquarters.[1] However, some maps have specific objectives, such as capturing a certain number of cities to claim victory.[1] The available modes of play include ""Field Training"" which is a tutorial mode,[1] a campaign mode[1] which carries the game's storyline, the ""War Room"" which is a collection of maps on which the player strives for high scores, as well as multiplayer modes and a map design mode. The ""Campaign"" and ""War Room"" modes both help to rank the player up (from Rank #100 to Rank #1) and to earn coins to unlock COs and maps in the ""Battle Maps"" shop.[1] The modes also gives the player a rank for effort after winning a battle on that map, which assesses by the speed, power, and technique in that battle, speed is the number of days spent trying to win the battle, power being how many enemy units you defeated, and technique is the number of your units that survived (in percentage).
The battles of Advance Wars are turn-based. Two to four armies, each headed by a commanding officer, take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps, while attacking enemy units, moving positions, holding ground, or capturing enemy/neutral properties (cities, ports, airports, bases, or HQ).[1]
 All units are limited in the types of units they can attack.[1] What dictates a unit's ability to attack different targets are its primary and secondary weapons. For example, the Mech unit has a bazooka that can only be fired at land vehicles, but are more powerful for that purpose than their secondary weapons, machine guns, which Mechs can use against other Mechs, infantry, and helicopters.
Units that can attack, do so either directly (can attack adjacent to another unit where standing or moved, but be counter-attacked by the enemy unit), or in-directly (must remain still to attack, and have an enemy in firing range). The amount of damage done by a unit to an enemy unit in combat, comes down to a number of factors: the number of hit points the attacker has, whether they can use their main weapon (if not, they either cannot, or will use their secondary weapon instead), the type of unit the attacker and the defender are, and the terrain the enemy unit is on; by contrast, if the enemy unit is directly attacked, the same factors determine the damage done when they counter-attack the attacking unit. The majority of units have main weapons with a limited supply of ammunition, with the amount of ammo depending on the type of unit. Units with secondary weapons will resort to these when their primary weapon's ammunition runs out until they are resupplied.
The terrain on a map affects unit movement, vision, and the defense attribute of units stationed in the terrain.[1] The different types of terrain include: roads, plains, woods, bases, HQs (Headquarters), ports, cities, airports, the sea, reefs, shoals, rivers, and mountains. All units are affected by terrain, except air units, which gain neither an advantage or a disadvantage as a result. Weather conditions, when active, can affect the vision and movement of ground units, while fog of war, when active, can reduce a player's vision, making them depend on individual units' lines of sight, which varies from unit to unit; infantry can expand the vision when in mountains, while woods and reefs can't be seen into unless a unit is adjacent to it.
There are 18 different types of military units in Advance Wars. Each unit has a set amount of attack power, vision range in Fog of war, movement range and type, and fuel supply, and some units have two weapons which can be used against different types of enemy units. There are both direct and indirect attack units, as well as transport units. All the units are either infantry, vehicles, ships or air units. Units have specific strengths and weaknesses. One rule of thumb that units have to adhere to is their fuel supply; ground units who run out cannot move, while air and naval units who run out are destroyed as they consume fuel even when stationary. Submarines consume more fuel than usual when submerged.[1]
In Multiplayer mode, players can compete against the AI or against other human players. Multiplayer matches feature a variety of settings that can be changed pre-battle. Multiplayer comes in two forms: Versus mode and Link mode. In Versus mode, only one GBA system is used, which every participant in the game uses. One person will take their turn, then pass the system to the next person. Link mode is the same game as Versus mode gameplay-wise, but multiple consoles are used, one for each person.[1] It can be played with just one game pak or with one game pak per player.
Armies are led by Commanding Officers who control units. Most COs provide units with innate special advantages and disadvantages, such as extra firepower, greater strength, or a shorter firing range, with some COs being better with some units than others (i.e. being better with air units, than naval units). COs also have a Power Meter which fills up by defeating enemy units or when on the receiving end of a brutal offensive attack. When the meter is full, a CO can unleash their CO Power, which gives a temporary positive effect to friendly units and/or a negative effect to enemy units.[1] For example, Nell gives a Critical Strike bonus and Olaf makes it snow, disadvantaging his opponent.

Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising,Yes (SPM),2003,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"NA, PAL","While the Allied Nations were still recovering from the war in Cosmo Land, the Black Hole Army had already recovered and has decided to launch a large-scale invasion on Macro Land. Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all.
Once the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations. Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion. The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World.
The Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm. In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile. Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail. However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered. Hawke takes over as leader of Black Hole, and along with Flak, Lash, and Adder, leaves Macro Land with the few troops he has left.[4]
","The goal of the player in Black Hole Rising, common to all of the Nintendo Wars series, is to defeat all of the enemies, sometimes by completing special objectives. Generally, the player can win by defeating all of the enemy's troops, or by capturing the enemy's headquarters. In certain campaign maps, there are special objectives, such as capturing or destroying certain key buildings, such as a Black Cannon, a new property found in Black Hole Rising.[6]
The Campaign mode in Black Hole Rising differs from its predecessor Advance Wars in that the mission selection is non-linear. The campaign takes place over the game's five continents, each focusing on one of the five countries in the game.[6] The player plays as one or more commanding officers of the protagonist nations, fighting against the antagonist of the game, Black Hole. Each continent begins with several missions that the player can select from. Upon meeting certain requirements, new missions may become available.[4] When the regular campaign has been completed, a more difficult Hard Campaign, in the vein of Advance Wars's Advance Campaign, can be unlocked, generally featuring modified maps and starting units.[4]
Completion of a campaign mission or War Room will net the player a rank based on several criteria.[7] When the campaign is completed, the player is given an overall rank, rewarding higher ranks with more unlockable content in the in-game shop.[4]
Many of Black Hole Rising's additional modes remains unchanged from its predecessor. In War Room Players are put in maps wherein they must defeat enemies who are usually given an advantage at the start. Versus mode allows the players to use either a pre-existing map or a user-created map and set up a game with customized settings. Versus mode can be used to create games played against the computer AI or other players by using hotseat gameplay. Multiplayer games with more than one game console is possible with Link mode, and requires the use of a Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.[8]
In Design mode, players can edit color palettes for existing commanding officers (after the player has unlocked the palettes) or create their own maps.[7] In the map editor, the size of the map is fixed and the player cannot choose to use any of the new Black Hole buildings introduced in Black Hole Rising. There are also certain rules the player must adhere to in order for the map to be considered playable. Maps created in this mode can be saved on the game cartridge and can be played in multiplayer modes or sent and received to other game cartridges using multiple consoles with a Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.[4]
Battle Maps remains as the game's shop, allowing players to purchase new content for the game by spending points earned in the other game modes. New content becomes available for purchase as the player progresses in the game. Available content for purchase includes new commanding officers, maps, and palettes to allow players to recolor commanding officers in Design mode.[4]
Black Hole Rising is nearly identical to the previous game in terms of core gameplay; the only additions were to the overall content of the game. Eight new commanding officers join the original game's eleven to make a total of nineteen. Many new maps were added for Versus mode and War Room, although most of the new maps and commanding officers are not available for use at the start of the game, and must be purchased from the in-game shop after certain conditions are met.[4]
Only one new unit, the Neotank, was added to the original set in Advance Wars.[9][10] Two new terrain features were introduced: the Missile Silo and the Pipeline (along with its breakable Pipe Seams).[9] The Missile Silo can be fired by foot troops to deal area of effect damage, and pipelines act as impassable walls. Because of its function as a wall, players can use it to create maps smaller than the default dimension the map editor provides, something that was not possible in the game's predecessor.
Along with the two terrain features, various new special Black Hole buildings were also introduced in Black Hole Rising, although they are only found in the game's campaign. These properties directly affected the gameplay of missions they are found in, creating new objectives for the player such as destroying or capturing one of these special buildings. An example of such a building is the large Black Cannon, which fires on one non-Black Hole unit each turn, dealing damage to it.[9] Destructible properties such as the Black Cannon have ""health"", represented by a heart icon. When units attack the property, the number decreases; when it reaches zero, the property is destroyed.[4]
One of the key added features of Black Hole Rising over its predecessor is the Super CO Power. The CO Power, introduced in Advance Wars, was a special ability unique to each commanding officer that could be triggered as the commanding officer's CO Meter filled by battle. CO Powers affected the game either by providing benefits for allied units and/or by inflicting negative effects on the enemy's units.[11] Black Hole Rising changed the format of the CO Meter to use small and large stars, although it essentially still functions as a fillable meter. A regular CO Power is still available by filling the small stars, but a more powerful Super CO Power, introduced in Black Hole Rising, can be triggered by filling the large stars as well.[9]
Although a Super CO Power is in many cases better than the normal CO Power, the CO Meter is drained differently depending on which power was activated. While Super CO Power will drain the CO Meter completely, the normal CO Power would leave players with some leftover charge on the CO Meter depending on how much existed before the CO Power. This allows for more strategy than Advance Wars since the player must now decide between using weaker abilities more frequently or greater abilities less frequently.[4]

After a death-defying game of chicken one evening in 1958, Akagi nonchalantly enters a yakuza mahjong parlor to shake the police's trail. Although he is unfamiliar with the rules of mahjong, his gambling intuition saves a small-time gambler, NangÅ (åé·) (voiced by Rikiya Koyama), and grants him a seat at the gambling table. As the night progresses, the stakes are raised both within the game and for Akagi, who is under the suspicion of the local policeman, Yasuoka (å®å²¡) (voiced by Tessho Genda). However, Akagi manages to defeat Keiji Yagi (ç¢æ¨ å­æ¬¡, Yagi Keiji) (voiced by Wataru Takagi)âdespite Yagi's cheating during the gameâand impresses the members of the gambling house.
Yasuoka arranges a new match against other yakuza members, in which Akagi defeats Ichikawa (å¸å·) (voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka), a blind professional mahjong player with very accurate hearing. After defeating him, Akagi gains mythical status at 13 but then disappears, becoming a legendary figure all over Japan. Six years later, Yasuoka orders Yukio Hirayama (å¹³å±± å¹¸é, Hirayama Yukio) (voiced by Ginpei Sato) to pretend to be Akagi to impress some yakuza bosses and make money. Meanwhile, NangÅ finds the real Akagi, now aged 19 and working at a toy factory. Akagi, however, does not need to play with Hirayama as Hirayama is defeated by Urabe (æµ¦é¨) (voiced by Morio Kazama), a professional mahjong player for another yakuza group who is later defeated by Akagi.
Akagi's ultimate rival is Iwao Washizu (é·²å·£ å·, Washizu Iwao) (voiced by Masane Tsukayama), an old man who has made a lot of money and become one of the most powerful people in the Japanese underworld. Having built up massive funds from shady dealings in Japan's post-war era, Washizu tempts people to bet their lives for the chance to win a large amount of money. Washizu and Akagi play mahjong in an unusual way that Washizu calls ""Washizu Mahjong,"" in which transparent glass tiles replace most of the tiles and make the game different in many ways.
Three years after the fight with Washizu, Akagi is last seen winning big in Tehonbiki, a gambling game that leaves no room for chance, and wandering around local gambling dens with Osamu Nozaki (éå´ æ²», Nozaki Osamu) (voiced by YÅ«dai SatÅ), a freckled young coworker from the toy factory they used to work at.

Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realms,Yes,2002,3d6 Games,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Altered Beast is a side scrolling beat 'em up game with light platform elements. It has five levels and can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Combat takes place across five levels set in Ancient Greece and populated by aggressive undead creatures and monsters resembling those from Greek mythology. The demonic god Neff, known as Majin (é­ç¥, ""magician"", ""sorcerer"", ""demon god"", ...) in Japan, waits at the end of each level.[1][2] Players can punch, kick and jump.[3]
The game's premise is that Neff, ruler of the underworld, captures the goddess Athena. Angry, her father, the Olympian god Zeus, decides to choose a champion to save her. Respecting the bravery of Roman Centurions, Zeus resurrects one of them and empowers him as a champion. The game's player character is the resurrected Roman Centurion, given extra power by Zeus so they can battle Neff and his supernatural minions.[4]
In the Japanese version of the game, there exists a race of beast warriors who have the ability to convert spiritual energy into physical power. When the limit of converted spiritual energy is reached, the beast warrior transforms into a literal beast that wields supernatural powers. When the beast warriors demand worship, Zeus steps in and freezes them all as stone statues. Later, the demonic Majin (Neff) kidnaps Athena. To rescue her, Zeus selects a beast warrior, the player character.
Whenever a player defeats a white two-headed wolf, a Spirit Ball power-up appears. Each obtained Spirit Ball increases the player character's strength and size. Collecting three Spirit Balls allows the player character to transform into a powerful beast form, increasing their combat abilities before having to face Neff at the end of the level. The player character's beast forms include a weredragon, a werebear, a weretiger, a werewolf, or a golden werewolf. Each beast form grants its own abilities. The dragon can unleash lightning bolts and an electric barrier, the bear has a petrifying breath that turns enemies into stone, the tiger can throw fireballs in a zig-zag pattern, the wolf can throw direct, but weak fireballs and has a powerful thrust attack, while the golden werewolf has the same abilities as the wolf form but stronger. In the Famicom version of the game, available beast forms also include a shark, lion, and phoenix form.[5]
If the Centurion doesn't obtain enough Spirit Balls to transform into a beast when he finds Neff, the villain will appear and then quickly leave. The player will need to continue the stage until they have enough Spirit Balls. Neff will appear a second time, but the points rewarded for his defeat will be lower. If the player character is still unable to transform, Neff will leave again, forcing the player to continue until he arrives for a third time. At this point, he will fight the Centurion no matter what, though once again the points rewarded for his defeat will be lowered.
In the original arcade game, the end credits include the revelation that the whole game actually depicted a staged film production and not a true battle between magical beings. The player character was not a hero traveling through different realms, only an actor playing the part of a hero, fighting actors and stunt fighters while special effects work provided the illusion of transformations and magical abilities.[6]

She is transported to the Flying City to begin her final examination.
Each of the candidates is given a land to populate. Whoever finishes populating their land first wins and becomes the next Queen. It is done with the help of nine Guardians who use their powers to make the people of the candidate's land happy, or to devastate their rival's lands. Along the way, the candidates become friends with the Guardians and can fall in love. If they choose love, they forfeit their chance to become Queen, but will live happily ever after.

The only method of travel between AniYoko and the human world is through a door mounted in the floor of Ami's bedroom. The Trio has given many conflicting and spurious explanations for how the door got there, but the real answer may never be revealed to Ami nor the viewer. Still, nothing overly sinister appears to be involved - As Kenta said in the second story, ""That's the setting for the story, so don't worry about it"", breaking the fourth wall, something that happens often in the show.
The door is two-way. It is most often used by the Trio to enter our world and interact with Ami, who they seem to find strangely fascinating. Ami could go through the door herself and enter AniYoko but, due to the insistent Trio and their strange often frightening stories, has yet to do so in the anime and AniYoko itself has never actually appeared, with only a dark space being shown whenever Ami looks inside. Scenes of AniYoko do appear in the Trio's recollections and stories, but these often are immediately shown to be false, and no objective AniYoko scenes have ever been shown. On one episode, it has shown Iyo's bedroom.
The presence of the door and the Trio seems to have had some effect on Ami's room itself. Ami and the Trio frequently find that they can go to many other places, such as a jungle, a forest, a baseball stadium (complete with crowd) and an RPG-style dungeon, without actually leaving the room.

Joe is arrested for fraud and is thrown into a temporary jail where he fights Nishi Kanichi, the leader of a group of hooligans. He and Nishi then go to the TÅkÅ High-Security Juvenile Prison (æ±åç¹ç­å°å¹´é¢, TÅkÅ TokutÅ ShÅnen'in), a juvenile detention center miles away from Tokyo. There Joe meets TÅru Rikiishi, a former boxing prodigy, and a rivalry develops between them after Rikiishi stopped Joe and Nishi from escaping the prison. They attempt to resolve the rivalry by facing each other in a boxing match in which Rikiishi dominates Joe until the latter hits him with a cross-counter, resulting in both being knocked out. Feeling that the outcome of the match did not resolve anything, Joe and Rikiishi vow to fight again. As Rikiishi learns he is meant to leave the prison, he challenges Joe to a fight in the future, and the two promise to meet again, this time as professional boxers.
Upon his release from prison, Joe initially has trouble gaining a boxing license due to his lack of formal education but succeeds in his second attempt with the help of Danpei and Nishi. Joe manages to go up to Bantamweight, after provoking a champion boxer named Wolf Kanagushi. Joe quickly rises in the ranks and gains popularity for his brawling style, and trademark cross-counter KO wins. Joe manages to perform a triple-cross counter on Wolf. Joe then earns the right to fight Rikiishi in the professional ring.
Although Rikiishi is assured a promising career, he is intent in settling his score with Joe, whom he feels stands in his path. Because Rikiishi is three weight classes above Joe, he has to cut down a massive amount of weight and undergoes an incredibly taxing weight loss program which includes severe dehydration. Rikiishi knocks Joe out in the 8th round and wins, but dies after from the combined effects of the extreme weight loss on his body and brain hemorrhage that he sustained from Joe during the fight.
Joe is still shaken up from that match, both mentally and physically. Soon after, during matches, his trainer Danpei realizes that Joe is unable to give headshots to his opponents, Rikiishi's accidental death having traumatized him. It takes Joe quite some time to get over it and costs him three straight losses and finally conquers his fears when he faces the globally #6 ranked Carlos Rivera. The fight ends with a draw, yet it gives Joe tremendous fame and respect around the world, especially since Carlos was going to face the World Champion JosÃ© Mendoza in his next match.
Joe starts to climb up the boxing ladder, but struggles with maintaining bantamweight due to a late growth spurt, forcing him to undergo strenuous training similar to what Rikiishi had to. He defeats the OPBF Champion, Kim Yong-bi, a South Korean boxer and survivor of the Korean War, dedicating the win to Rikiishi. After winning the title match, Joe defends his title. He wins all defenses, ultimately defending it against the Malaysian fighter Harimau. He is now given the chance to face the World Champion JosÃ© Mendoza, who defeated Carlos Rivera with a KO punch in the first round, ending his boxing career. It is later revealed that Carlos had developed permanent brain damage from his fight.
The fight is held in a packed stadium, and is attended by many of Joe's friends and former rivals, including Wolf and the now sickly and haggard Carlos. Joe faces Mendoza, even though he is at a disadvantage since it was revealed he was punch-drunk, and has lost vision in one eye. The match is a brutal back-and-forth with Joe able to knock down the Champion more than once. Though originally composed, JosÃ© starts losing his mind as Joe keeps getting up no matter how much damage he takes, to the point that he wonders if he is trapped in a nightmare. The match goes all of its fifteen rounds, with Mendoza barely gaining a win by points, but much to the shock of the audience, JosÃ© has seemingly aged decades in minutes from the toll the fight has taken on his body, with his hair turned snow white from the trauma he has experienced. Danpei turns to console Joe only to find him unresponsive, but with a smile on his face. It has been debated among fans whether Joe died or not and Chiba even said that he drew the ending scene at the last minute.[2]

Asterix and Obelix then fight off many more Roman soldiers, plowing through a country road. After finally defeating all of the warriors, the two discover a padlocked wagon at the end of the road. Obelix breaks open the door, and the village druid, Getafix, clambers out. He explains to them that while he was locked up, he overheard Caesar's plans to send the Gaulish villagers to different parts of the Roman Empire. Their locations were etched into a white marble map, which Caesar smashed after showing to his soldiers. Thus, Getafix returns to the village, and Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix set off to the first location to free their fellow villagers from the clutches of the Romans.[3][4]
","Gameplay involves the rescuing of various villagers while solving large puzzles and defeating the Roman masses. The player automatically switches between Asterix and Obelix depending on the situation. The two characters have slight differences, such as in speed or strength. The only significant difference is Obelix's ability to smash iron crates without magic potion and his ability to push and pull larger platforms than can Asterix. Many puzzles involve the use of a special reusable torch that only Asterix may carry, and a sliding platform guided by a rope, both of which occur in every province of the Roman Empire.
The player may redeem helmets collected from defeated Romans. These helmets can be used to purchase power-ups, such as extra health and new attack combinations from a traveling merchant in each province. There are two types of helmet: ordinary grunts' helmets (worth 1 helmet) and gold centurions' helmets (worth 10 helmets). The latter are usually acquired from iron crates or dropped by high-ranking enemies, such as commanders and gladiators. The player can also pick up gourds of magic potion, which are found regularly. These can only be consumed by Asterix, and are used immediately when collected. After consuming the potion, the player becomes much more powerful for an extremely limited time. The potion allows Asterix to defeat Romans in a single hit and to run much faster. In addition, they allow a player to perform a triple jump and smash iron crates. If Asterix consumes another potion while already under the effect of a previous one, he will generate a huge shockwave that causes all nearby enemies to drop their weapons.
Combat is performed by bashing the Romans with bare hands. The ordinary grunts are the easiest to defeat, with many more powerful classes of enemies. After being bashed, certain enemies will remain dazed for a few moments, at which point some of them can be picked up and swung around the head like a lasso, damaging all other enemies in the vicinity and breaking nearby crates. Dogmatix can also be dispatched during battle. He will bite the enemy soldiers, causing them to drop their weapons and rendering them easily vulnerable to attack.
In each province, the heroes will encounter the Roman agent, who will provide them with helpful information on operating machinery and bring them up to date on the Romans' latest plans. At the end of each province (with the exception of Gaul), there is a boss fight. The bosses are invariably large machines of war, operated by several Romans. After the machines are destroyed, the captive villagers are set free, and they provide Asterix and Obelix with another section of the marble map, allowing them to continue on and rescue the other villagers. Each province (with the exceptions of Gaul and Rome) contain unique enemies native to that area. Players are able to revisit any previous areas in order to collect more helmets, or to find more Golden Laurels.
Throughout the game, players may find Golden laurel wreaths, accessible under different conditions; some are as simple as picking them up, while others are obtained by complex puzzles or fulfilling various conditions. The laurel wreaths when collected permit the player to unlock hidden bonuses, such as new attire, purely for cosmetic effect.
Transport in the game is fulfilled by a manner of catapulting. At different points in an area, the player may find a catapult, which when used will send the player to the next location nearby instantaneously.

Asteroids / Pong / Yars' Revenge,,2005,ECI Interactive,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward.[7] Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.[8]
Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges â for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction.[9] As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the ""big saucer"" shoots randomly and poorly, while the ""small saucer"" fires frequently at the ship. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears. As the player's score increases, the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately.[10] Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between 40,000 and 60,000.[11] The player starts with 3â5 lives upon game start and gains an extra life per 10,000 points.[12] Play continues to the last ship lost, which ends the game. Machine ""turns over"" at 99,990 points, which is the maximum high score that can be achieved.
In the original game design, saucers were supposed to begin shooting as soon as they appeared, but this was changed.[10]  Additionally, saucers can only aim at the player's ship on-screen; they are not capable of aiming across a screen boundary. These behaviors allow a ""lurking"" strategy, in which the player stays near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer. By keeping just one or two rocks in play, a player can shoot across the boundary and destroy saucers to accumulate points indefinitely with little risk of being destroyed.[12][13]  Arcade operators began to complain about losing revenue due to this exploit. In response, Atari issued a patched EPROM and, due to the impact of this exploit, Atari (and other companies) changed their development and testing policies to try to prevent future games from having such exploits.[10]

Astro Boy: Omega Factor|Astro Boy: Tetsuwan AtomJP,No,2003,Hitmaker,Sega,"NA, PAL, JP","Omega Factor features elements from Astro Boy's different incarnations. The concept of robot rights, Dr. Tenma's ultimate plan for Astro and the robot city of Robotonia in Antarctica are lifted from the Astro Boy 2003 TV series. Plotlines from other Tezuka series include a time travel plot lifted from Marine Express, a journey to the lost continent of Mu, and a subplot involving Duke Red's daughter and her role in the ""Death Mask"" orbital platform. The game is divided into two episodes: Birth and Rebirth. The Birth episode follows Astro's adventures and other characters he interacts with, and ends with robots being destroyed by a device called Death Mask, after it determines that the robots are too dangerous to be left alive, leaving Sharaku able to conquer the Earth. In Rebirth, Astro is revived by a being called Phoenix, and has Astro go back to the beginning of the story and try to stop the Death Mask, giving him the ability to go back and forward in time to do so.
The story includes characters from Tezuka's entire canon of work. The characters are listed in the ""Omega Factor"", an in-game encyclopedia of the Astro Boy fictional universe, which provides a detailed character biography, including each character's appearances and roles in Tezuka's works.[9]
","Omega Factor is a beat 'em up game starring Astro Boy, the main character of the Astro Boy media franchise.[2] Astro attacks enemies using high-powered punches and kicks,[3] which can also knock enemies into other ones and destroy them as well. Doing some damage to the enemies will slowly fill the EX gauge at the top of the screen.[4] Once the gauge is filled, Astro is able to perform a special attack;[5] rather than simply helping the player, these are required in some situations. Astro is also able to fly using rocket power, which is also sometimes necessary.[6]
Every non-player character the player meets scores a point that can be used to improve one of Astro's stats, such as strength or flight speed.[7] This is generally not necessary to beat the game, but the incremental stat increases can make the game easier, as well as allowing the player to find hidden areas in levels.[6] The game features two difficulty levels in the Japanese version, and three in the North American and European versions.[8]

Avatar: The Last AirbenderNA|Avatar: The Legend of AangPAL,,2006,THQ / TOSE / Halfbrick,THQ,"NA, PAL","The main playable characters in the Avatar: The Last Airbender video game are Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Haru, the former three of which are main characters in the television series the video game is based on.
Aang is the fun-loving, 112-year-old (physically 12) protagonist of the video game, he was frozen in an iceberg for a century. He is the current incarnation of the Avatar, a human whose essence is forever bonded with that of the Avatar Spirit of Light and Peace. As the Avatar, Aang must master all four elements to bring peace to the world and restore the order between the Four Nations. Aiding him is the fourteen-year-old Katara, the sole remaining waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe, and her older brother Sokka, a fifteen-year-old warrior of the Southern Water Tribe. Haru is a young teenage Earthbender who helps the gang in their mission to save a missing friend. Many characters from the show appear on this; King Bumi, who appears in the fourth level.
While training at the Northern Water Tribe, Avatar Aang and Katara hear reports of a waterbender, Hiryu, going missing, which they investigate. They arrive at the Water Tribe as a Fire Nation ship attacks, led by Prince Zuko. They are able to fend off the attackers, but Katara is captured during the battle. Aang and Sokka follow the ship, but are slowed by a firebending machine. 
They follow the ship to an Earth Kingdom port. They slip into the jail and release Katara, who informs them of another prisoner named Lian the Maker, who is being forced to make machines for the Fire Nation. When they arrive at Lian's cell, they find it empty, except for a map to an Earth Kingdom village.
They find the village under attack by machines. After fending off the machines, picking up Haru and being informed that one of his earthbending friends Yuan was kidnapped, they travel to the library of Omashu for clues to where the machines might originate from. The information from the library leads them to an uncharted island.
On the island, they find Lian, making more machines. She fears that Avatar Aang will not be able to master all four elements before Sozin's comet arrives. Aang refused her help, seeing as how the machines were disrupting villages. Lian then voiced her contempt for him as she sends a machine to fight them to flee to the Air temple, attempting to destroy the Avatar statues. They stop Lian, but Katara, Sokka, and Haru are all captured by another machine.
Aang pursues Lian and the machine to a fortress. After Aang rescues his friends, they find Prince Zuko, also captured by a machine. Upon rescuing him, Prince Zuko attacks the group. At the end of the resulting fight, the Fire Nation prince is knocked over a cliff and swept over a waterfall.
The four enter the fortress, where they find Lian, where she finished a machine being manned by the missing waterbender Hiryu, Haru's friend Yuan and a nameless firebender. Lian tries to attach Aang to the machine, but he battles it instead. During the fight, Katara is struck down, causing a furious Aang to enter the powerful Avatar State and destroy the machine once and for all, burying Lian under its rubble, killing her (though she survives in the portable versions of the game.)
As the four leave the fortress, Prince Zuko is seen crawling up on the shoreline, grumbling angrily, due to having failed to capture the Avatar.
","The Avatar: The Last Airbender video game allows the player to control one of four characters â Aang, Katara, Haru, or Sokka â in a single-player adventure. Each character uses his or her own trademark weapon and fighting style, and is able to earn new special abilities through experience gained from defeating enemies. A variety of items can help the player with quests, or during battle (armor, chi, enchanted accessories, and healing potions). The game also enables the player to collect certain resources and bring them to artisans to make special items. Enemies include classic Firebenders, machines, and a variety of animals from the show, mainly the first book.
The console versions of the game were developed by THQ Studio Australia.

Backyard Basketball,,2004,"Humongous Entertainment, Mistic",Atari,,NaN,"Backyard Basketball offers two primary modes of gameplay: Single Game, which allows the player to select a team to compete against a computer-controlled team, and Season Play, which allows the player to select a team to compete against a series of computer-controlled teams over an 18-game season, including two best-of-three playoff series and a best-of-five championship series should the player achieve a large number of victories. The Single Game mode also allows the player to compete against a second player or to practice using a single character.
Before games can occur, the player has the option to modify a variety of settings. These include court selection, A.I. difficulty (easy, medium, or hard), the presence of certain rules (fouls, fatigue, violations, shot control, and power-ups), sound options (game music, background sounds, and in-game dialogue), controls, and team names. Team modification also involves the customization of jerseys.
The game's controls are set to mouse usage by default, capitalizing on a point & click style of gameplay to move characters around. The game is also compatible with keyboards and game pads.
The selection of team members follows one of two settings: First Five Picks, which allows each player to select their team members freely, or Full Draft, which forces each player to select their team members one at a time in an alternating fashion.  Each potential team member, including younger versions of Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie, is ranked according to five statistics operating on a 1 to 10 scale. These include Inside Shooting (the relative accuracy of the character's shot from inside the three-point line), Outside Shooting (the relative accuracy of the character's shot from beyond the three-point line), Ballhandling (the relative likelihood that the character will not have the ball stolen or blocked on offense), Defense (the relative likelihood that the character will be able to steal or block the ball on defense), and Quickness (the relative speed at which the character moves along the court). Players also have the option to customize rookie characters with either manually chosen or randomly allocated statistics, as well as heights, skin tones, shooting hands, birthdays, and names. Although rookie characters generally have lower overall statistics compared to pre-rendered players, they have the additional ability to increase all of their statistics by three levels should the player's team make the playoffs in Season Play.
Gameplay in Backyard Basketball is set to a point & click control scheme by default. With three characters on the court at one time, the player clicks at various locations on the court to guide the character with the ball to that location. Clicking on a teammate causes the character to pass the ball to that teammate while clicking the basket (indicated by a basketball icon) causes the character to attempt a shot. If shot control is on, then players have the option to make the shooting character pump fake by clicking rapidly, finally shooting the ball when the click is held down. If shot control is off, then the character will automatically release the shot once the basketball icon is clicked.
On defense, the player can switch between characters to control by clicking on them as they run about, guiding the chosen character by clicking the location on the court where he or she should go. If an opposing character is clicked when an 'X' symbol hovers by them, the character nearest him or her will attempt to steal the ball. If a pair of hands appears near the basket when an opposing character goes to shoot the ball, the nearest character will attempt to block the shot or rebound the ball.
Each quarter of a game lasts approximately three minutes while each overtime period (if necessary) lasts approximately one minute. The longer characters play without rest, the more tired and prone to mistakes (poor shooting and ball-handling) they will be; as such, substitutions can be made after any completed play or during a time-out. Characters will recover their energy while on the bench (only two players can stay on the bench at a time). Granted, a character's energy will never decrease if the fatigue option is turned off.
Over the course of a game, power-ups may occasionally be rewarded to teams. The majority of these power-ups are useful, such as the flaming ball (which guarantees that the next attempted shot will go in), the tornado (which increases the speed of all characters on the court), the doughnut (which causes the next character who attempts a shot to automatically attempt a slam dunk), and 110% Juice (which provides energy to otherwise tired players if the fatigue option is turned on). However, some power-ups provide detrimental effects, such as the icy ball (which makes shots more likely to miss), the stick of butter (which reduces the team's ball-handling abilities), and the ice cream truck (which prevents the entire team from moving for a brief period of time).

Bakuten Shoot Beyblade: Gekitou! Saikyou Blade,,2001,AI,Broccoli,JP,"Tyson Granger (æ¨ãå®®ã¿ã«ãª, Takao Kinomiya) is an enthusiastic young man who loves Beyblade. He begins his journey after befriending fellow Beyblade enthusiast, Kenny, and drawing the attention of Kai Hiwatari, a formidable Blader, after defeating Carlos, the leader of his neighborhood's Beyblade gang, the Blade Sharks. Tyson and Kai develop a rivalry that leads to him discovering that his Beyblade contains a Bit-Beast named Dragoon. Seeking to challenge Kai again, Tyson competes in the Japanese Regional Beyblade Qualifying Tournament and befriends fellow competitors, Ray Kon and Max Tate, both of whom possess their own Bit-Beast.
After winning the tournament, Tyson goes on to form a team with Kai, Ray and Max named the Bladebreakers. Kenny tags along as their manager. The Bladebreakers tour China to register for the championships and confront the White Tigers, Ray's former team, who hold a grudge against Ray for leaving them. Toward the end of the Chinese tournament, Ray and his ex-teammates make amends, and the Bladebreakers win the tournament.
After this, Tyson and his friends arrive in the United States to fight the All Starz, who are coached by Max's mother. After winning the American League, the team finds itself stranded in Europe. They tour Europe and meet Oliver, Enrique, Johnny and Robert, who go by the name Majestics.
The Bladebreakers battle the Majestics and the Bladebreakers win the battle. They then go to Russia for the final tournament. In Russia, they meet Boris's team, the Demolition Boys, of which Kai was also a member of in the past. Kai had forgotten about Boris and the training grounds where he had learned almost everything he knew about Beyblading. However, he soon regains his memory. He finds Black Dranzer, his dream Beyblade, and decides to join the Demolition Boys team, aiming to be the best Beyblader. Tyson finds out and tries to convince Kai to return to the Bladebreakers, but Kai rejects him, throwing his old Beyblade, Dranzer, at Tyson's feet. Tyson keeps Dranzer with him and vows to bring Kai back. Soon, before the finals, Kai challenges the Bladebreakers to steal their Bit-Beasts and become most powerful Blader. However, only Tyson and Ray show up. Max is still at the airport, returning from where he was training with Tyson and Ray with his new Beyblade, Draciel. Just at the moment when Kai seems to be close to taking the Bit-Beasts of Tyson and Ray, Max comes and challenges Kai. Kai thinks that he can easily beat Draciel but he can not, and soon Tyson uses Kai's own old Blade, Dranzer, to beat the Black Dranzer and defeat Kai. Kai, shocked by the power of Dranzer, does not notice the ice beneath him cracking and falls into the frozen water below. Tyson, Ray, Max and Kenny rescue Kai. Realizing the power of friendship as well as the power of Dranzer, Kai returns to the Bladebreakers.
In the final match, Tyson battles Tala, winning the match and becoming a Beyblade World Champion for the first time.
The Bladebreakers have gone their separate ways. But when Team Psykick and the Saint Shields attack the Bladebreakers and try to steal their Bit-Beasts, the Bladebreakers reassemble to defeat the new enemies. Tyson's classmate Hilary Tachibana (Hiromi Tachibana) joins the Bladebreakers but takes time to learn that Beyblade is not just the stupid game she thinks it is.
In an attempt to steal the four Bit-Beasts from the Bladebreakers, Team Psykick creates four cyber Bit-Beast copies of the Bladebreakers' Bit-Beasts and recruit four skilled bladers named Kane, Salima, Goki, and Jim. These teenagers were pure-hearted and innocent bladers with high ambitions, but the dark power of the cyber Bit-Beasts gradually take over their minds and turn them evil. The first half of the second season ends with the Bladebreakers defeating Team Psykick. Tyson, Ray, Kai and Max battle Kane, Salima, Goki and Jim respectively and defeat them. After the cyber beasts are destroyed Team Psykick come back to their normal selves and regain consciousness. The second half of Season 2 deals with the truth of why the Saint Shields and Team Psykick are after Bladebreakers' Bit-Beasts and about a rock that Max's mother found that contains Bit-Beasts, which is stolen by Team Psykick.
The Saint Shields' reason behind attempting to steal the Bit-Beasts is because they wish to seal them in a rock because they fear that the Bit-Beasts could get out of control like they did in the past. The Saint Shields battle the Bladebreakers and manage to seal Ray's Bit-Beast Driger into a sealing stone. Later Ray reclaims Driger and defeats all the Saint Shields in a team face-off. The Psykick's leader, Dr. Zagart, wants the Bit-Beasts to turn his android son Zeo (an exact replica of his son who died in an accident) into a real human.
After defeating the Saint Shields, Tyson meets Zeo and befriends him without knowing that he is the son of Team Psykick's leader. Zeo is unaware that he is an android and that his father is behind all of Team Psykick's plans. Later Zeo finds out about his past and decides to help his father in his plans. Dr. Zagart gives Zeo a bit beast named Cerberus, the strongest Bit-Beast sealed in the rock. Zeo enters the world Beyblade tournament with the motive of defeating all the Bladebreakers members and stealing their Bit-Beasts. In the tournament, Zeo defeats Kai and Max and steals their Bit-Beasts Dranzer and Draciel. But in the final battle Tyson and Dragoon (Tyson's Bit-Beast) defeat Zeo and Cerberus. In the process, Tyson and Max's team win the world tournament. Dranzer and Draciel come back to their original bladers, Kai and Max.
Kai, Ray, and Max left Tyson and went their separate ways to rejoin their old teams so that they have a chance to beat each other at the World Championship which has been re-designed with tag-teams of two. Max joins the PPB All Starz, Ray joins White Tiger X, and Kai joins the Blitzkrieg Boys. This leaves only Tyson, Hilary, and Kenny on the team. A new character, Daichi Sumeragi, and Tyson's older brother, Hiro Granger, join them. The two other teams involved are the Barthez Battalion and F-Dynasty.
One week after the results of the World Championships, Boris, the secondary villain from the first season, returns and creates the new Beyblade Entertainment Global Association, (BEGA) replacing the BBA. Boris tries to fool Tyson and co. into believing he has made up for his past, while he is actually trying to gain control over all Bladers and Beyblading activity. After a while however, they see what Boris is trying to pull. Tyson challenges BEGA's best to a battle, and Boris decides to hold a 5-on-5 tournament in one month's time. But he declares that all the Beyblade shops must sell Beyblades and their parts to BEGA associated Beybladers only, otherwise they will not be allowed to run the shops.
Tyson and the team find some parts at Max's father's store, which are insufficient. Then after sometime Kenny comes with the solution, he makes a new type of Beyblades known as hard metal Beyblades, using a different type of parts. But they still needed one more blader, and that is when Kai, who tried to join BEGA but lost severely to Brooklyn, disbanded the Blitzkrieg Boys and rejoined the team now known as the G Revolutions. Additionally during the BEGA qualifying matches Kai's former teammates, Spencer and Bryan of the Blitzkrieg Boys defeat a BEGA Training squad but lose easily to a mysterious blader known as Garland Siebald. Tala, the leader of the Blitzkrieg Boys who was previously the final boss in season 1, takes on Garland but lost the match and was seriously injured after Garland activated his attack, Radiant Thunder and ended the match. Daichi and Ray lose the first two matches to Ming-Ming and Crusher only proving that their hard metal blades were also no match for their powerful blades. Max ends the third match with Mystel in a draw. Then it is Kai's turn. He chooses unbeaten Brooklyn as his Opponent. Kai defeats Brooklyn in that match. Then Tyson beats Garland. Brooklyn becomes insane due to his loss to Kai and start having nightmares about Kai. After that, he confronts Tyson. In the ensuing match, Tyson and Brooklyn battle it out in the tie-breaker match. As the final fight rages on, Brooklyn goes berserk and merges with his bit-beast Zeus which threatens to destroy the entire universe. in the end Tyson is able to absorb the powers of every single Bit-Beast and after a final attack, Brooklyn became normal while both blades were still spinning (but the match after that was not shown). And the BEGA corporation had fallen thanks to the efforts of the Bladebreakers (G-Revolutions). The episode ends with Tyson and Kai to have one final match.
In the Japanese version, the episode ends with a special ending showing every major character from the series.

The first half of the second season ends with the Bladebreakers defeating Team Psykick. Tyson, Ray, Kai and Max battle Kane, Salima, Goki and Jim respectively and defeat them. After the cyber beasts are destroyed Team Psykick come back to their normal selves and regain consciousness. The second half of Season 2 deals with the truth of why the Saint Shields and Team Psykick are after Bladebreakers' Bit-Beasts and about a rock that Max's mother found that contains Bit-Beasts, which is stolen by Team Psykick.
The Saint Shields' reason behind attempting to steal the Bit-Beasts is because they wish to seal them in a rock because they fear that the Bit-Beasts could get out of control like they did in the past. The Saint Shields battle the Bladebreakers and manage to seal Ray's Bit-Beast Driger into a sealing stone. Later Ray reclaims Driger and defeats all the Saint Shields in a team face-off. The Psykick's leader, Dr. Zagart, wants the Bit-Beasts to turn his android son Zeo (an exact replica of his son who died in an accident) into a real human.
After defeating the Saint Shields, Tyson meets Zeo and befriends him without knowing that he is the son of Team Psykick's leader. Zeo is unaware that he is an android and that his father is behind all of Team Psykick's plans. Later Zeo finds out about his past and decides to help his father in his plans. Dr. Zagart gives Zeo a bit beast named Cerberus, the strongest Bit-Beast sealed in the rock. Zeo enters the world Beyblade tournament with the motive of defeating all the Bladebreakers members and stealing their Bit-Beasts. In the tournament, Zeo defeats Kai and Max and steals their Bit-Beasts Dranzer and Draciel. But in the final battle Tyson and Dragoon (Tyson's Bit-Beast) defeat Zeo and Cerberus. In the process, Tyson and Max's team win the world tournament. Dranzer and Draciel come back to their original bladers, Kai and Max.
Kai, Ray, and Max left Tyson and went their separate ways to rejoin their old teams so that they have a chance to beat each other at the World Championship which has been re-designed with tag-teams of two. Max joins the PPB All Starz, Ray joins White Tiger X, and Kai joins the Blitzkrieg Boys. This leaves only Tyson, Hilary, and Kenny on the team. A new character, Daichi Sumeragi, and Tyson's older brother, Hiro Granger, join them. The two other teams involved are the Barthez Battalion and F-Dynasty.
One week after the results of the World Championships, Boris, the secondary villain from the first season, returns and creates the new Beyblade Entertainment Global Association, (BEGA) replacing the BBA. Boris tries to fool Tyson and co. into believing he has made up for his past, while he is actually trying to gain control over all Bladers and Beyblading activity. After a while however, they see what Boris is trying to pull. Tyson challenges BEGA's best to a battle, and Boris decides to hold a 5-on-5 tournament in one month's time. But he declares that all the Beyblade shops must sell Beyblades and their parts to BEGA associated Beybladers only, otherwise they will not be allowed to run the shops.
Tyson and the team find some parts at Max's father's store, which are insufficient. Then after sometime Kenny comes with the solution, he makes a new type of Beyblades known as hard metal Beyblades, using a different type of parts. But they still needed one more blader, and that is when Kai, who tried to join BEGA but lost severely to Brooklyn, disbanded the Blitzkrieg Boys and rejoined the team now known as the G Revolutions. Additionally during the BEGA qualifying matches Kai's former teammates, Spencer and Bryan of the Blitzkrieg Boys defeat a BEGA Training squad but lose easily to a mysterious blader known as Garland Siebald. Tala, the leader of the Blitzkrieg Boys who was previously the final boss in season 1, takes on Garland but lost the match and was seriously injured after Garland activated his attack, Radiant Thunder and ended the match. Daichi and Ray lose the first two matches to Ming-Ming and Crusher only proving that their hard metal blades were also no match for their powerful blades. Max ends the third match with Mystel in a draw. Then it is Kai's turn. He chooses unbeaten Brooklyn as his Opponent. Kai defeats Brooklyn in that match. Then Tyson beats Garland. Brooklyn becomes insane due to his loss to Kai and start having nightmares about Kai. After that, he confronts Tyson. In the ensuing match, Tyson and Brooklyn battle it out in the tie-breaker match. As the final fight rages on, Brooklyn goes berserk and merges with his bit-beast Zeus which threatens to destroy the entire universe. in the end Tyson is able to absorb the powers of every single Bit-Beast and after a final attack, Brooklyn became normal while both blades were still spinning (but the match after that was not shown). And the BEGA corporation had fallen thanks to the efforts of the Bladebreakers (G-Revolutions). The episode ends with Tyson and Kai to have one final match.
In the Japanese version, the episode ends with a special ending showing every major character from the series.

Bakuten Shoot Beyblade 2002: Gekisen! Team Battle!! Kouryuu no Shou - Daichi Version,,2002,Hudson Soft,Broccoli,JP,"Tyson Granger (æ¨ãå®®ã¿ã«ãª, Takao Kinomiya) is an enthusiastic young man who loves Beyblade. He begins his journey after befriending fellow Beyblade enthusiast, Kenny, and drawing the attention of Kai Hiwatari, a formidable Blader, after defeating Carlos, the leader of his neighborhood's Beyblade gang, the Blade Sharks. Tyson and Kai develop a rivalry that leads to him discovering that his Beyblade contains a Bit-Beast named Dragoon. Seeking to challenge Kai again, Tyson competes in the Japanese Regional Beyblade Qualifying Tournament and befriends fellow competitors, Ray Kon and Max Tate, both of whom possess their own Bit-Beast.
After winning the tournament, Tyson goes on to form a team with Kai, Ray and Max named the Bladebreakers. Kenny tags along as their manager. The Bladebreakers tour China to register for the championships and confront the White Tigers, Ray's former team, who hold a grudge against Ray for leaving them. Toward the end of the Chinese tournament, Ray and his ex-teammates make amends, and the Bladebreakers win the tournament.
After this, Tyson and his friends arrive in the United States to fight the All Starz, who are coached by Max's mother. After winning the American League, the team finds itself stranded in Europe. They tour Europe and meet Oliver, Enrique, Johnny and Robert, who go by the name Majestics.
The Bladebreakers battle the Majestics and the Bladebreakers win the battle. They then go to Russia for the final tournament. In Russia, they meet Boris's team, the Demolition Boys, of which Kai was also a member of in the past. Kai had forgotten about Boris and the training grounds where he had learned almost everything he knew about Beyblading. However, he soon regains his memory. He finds Black Dranzer, his dream Beyblade, and decides to join the Demolition Boys team, aiming to be the best Beyblader. Tyson finds out and tries to convince Kai to return to the Bladebreakers, but Kai rejects him, throwing his old Beyblade, Dranzer, at Tyson's feet. Tyson keeps Dranzer with him and vows to bring Kai back. Soon, before the finals, Kai challenges the Bladebreakers to steal their Bit-Beasts and become most powerful Blader. However, only Tyson and Ray show up. Max is still at the airport, returning from where he was training with Tyson and Ray with his new Beyblade, Draciel. Just at the moment when Kai seems to be close to taking the Bit-Beasts of Tyson and Ray, Max comes and challenges Kai. Kai thinks that he can easily beat Draciel but he can not, and soon Tyson uses Kai's own old Blade, Dranzer, to beat the Black Dranzer and defeat Kai. Kai, shocked by the power of Dranzer, does not notice the ice beneath him cracking and falls into the frozen water below. Tyson, Ray, Max and Kenny rescue Kai. Realizing the power of friendship as well as the power of Dranzer, Kai returns to the Bladebreakers.
In the final match, Tyson battles Tala, winning the match and becoming a Beyblade World Champion for the first time.
The Bladebreakers have gone their separate ways. But when Team Psykick and the Saint Shields attack the Bladebreakers and try to steal their Bit-Beasts, the Bladebreakers reassemble to defeat the new enemies. Tyson's classmate Hilary Tachibana (Hiromi Tachibana) joins the Bladebreakers but takes time to learn that Beyblade is not just the stupid game she thinks it is.

Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance,,2004,Magic Pockets,Destination Software,"NA, PAL","The game takes place in the Sword Coast and the Western Heartlands, areas in the FaerÃ»n continent of the Forgotten Realms. Each act of the game takes place in a different region: Act I takes place in the city of Baldur's Gate itself; Act II in the Sunset Mountains; and Act III in the Marsh of Chelimber.
The game begins with Vahn, Adrianna and Kromlech arriving in Baldur's Gate, whereupon they are attacked by a group of thieves led by Karne (voiced by Michael Bell). The thieves are about to kill the trio when they are interrupted by the city watch, who take the newcomers to the nearby Elfsong Tavern to recover. There, the bartender, Alyth Elendara (Jennifer Hale), assists them in earning some money by giving them the job of clearing the tavern's cellar of rats. In the cellar, they discover the thieves are using the tavern's sewer entrance to infiltrate the city. When Elfsong Tavern employee Ethon, follows them into the sewers and disappears, they agree to Alyth's plea to find him. They rescue Ethon from the thieves, and he directs them to the nearby crypts, where one of the thieves was heading. There they encounter Fayed (Cam Clarke), a priest of Illmater, who requests their help in stopping the ""Orb of the Undead"", which has filled the crypts with zombies and skeletons. They succeed in destroying the orb and discover the thieves, collectively known as Xantam's Guild, are behind its placement. Ethon then introduces them to Jherek (John Rhys-Davies), a member of the Harpers, a group dedicated to protecting the realms from evil. Impressed with how they have handled themselves, he invites them to join the Harpers and destroy Xantham's Guild. They agree, and Jherek shows them the guild's entrance in the sewers.
After navigating a gauntlet of traps they face and kill Karne, and then advance to find the guild master, the beholder Xantam (Tony Jay). He reveals the guild is only a small part of a much greater whole. They fight and kill him, and Jherek asks them to enter a portal which Xantam was guarding. The portal transports them to the Sunset Mountains, whereupon they head to a dwarf mining village, which is being oppressed by drow elves. They light a signal fire atop a nearby mountain, calling for aid from neighboring dwarven clans, and then enter the mines to rout the drow. After killing the drow priestess, they rescue a dwarven Harper, who tells them of another portal in the mountains. He also tells them that troops and monsters are planning to use the portals to move from the mountains into Baldur's Gate, attacking the city from within. The adventurers head to the portal, finding it guarded by the ice dragon Ciraxis. They slay him and pass through the portal into the Marsh of Chelimber.
There they are greeted by Sleyvas (Kevin Michael Richardson), one of the native lizardfolk. He tells them of the nearby ""Onyx Tower"", and of its inhabitant, Eldrith the Betrayer (Vanessa Marshall), who has sworn vengeance against Baldur's Gate. He then reveals that his kin, led by the lizard Sess'sth, are serving Eldrith. The trio fight through the marsh's hordes of lizardfolk, kill Sess'sth, and cripple the lizard army. Sleyvas then leads them to the Onyx Tower, which they can only enter by taking a detour through the Elemental Plane of Water. Once inside the tower, they see firsthand Eldrith's preparations for war and fight their way upwards, through legions of Eldrith's soldiers.
At the penultimate level of the tower they meet the ghost of Keledon (Dwight Schultz), first captain of the company of the Westering Sun. He explains that Eldrith once served Baldur's Gate as its greatest general, fighting a crusade against the Black Horde. Upon successfully defending the city, she defied orders and led her army in pursuit of the retreating Horde. Trapping them in a ravine, they proved stronger than she had anticipated, and she sent word to the city for re-enforcements. The re-enforcements never came, and Eldrith's army was defeated, although she survived. Furious, she rallied her remaining soldiers to attack Baldur's Gate itself, but was again defeated. The city's soldiers then pursued her and her few remaining men to the Marshes of Chelimber where they were all killed. However, Eldrith's rage was such that she returned to life, bringing forth the Onyx Tower, which gave her access to the portals. Seeking revenge, she orchestrated the attacks against Baldur's Gate, and created a dark alliance between Xantam's guild, the drow, and Sess'sth's tribes.
Keleon explains that if the trio defeat Eldrith, it will mean the destruction of the Tower itself, as well as freeing the ghosts within. However, as they cannot leave the tower the way they entered, it will most likely lead to their own deaths. They find Eldrith alone on the roof of the Tower guarding another portal. She reiterates her plans for the destruction of Baldur's Gate. They fight and defeat her, and as she dies, she repents her actions and asks forgiveness. With the tower crumbling around them, the heroes enter the portal, not knowing where it leads.
As the Onyx Tower explodes from within, Sleyvas' true motives are revealed: he has manipulated and used the heroes to defeat Eldrith for his unidentified master. He tells his master that the heroes have died within the tower and Eldrith is no longer an obstacle. As such, they can now proceed with their plans. Meanwhile, the trio emerge in an unknown forest, and are immediately surrounded by dark creatures who swoop upon them. The game concludes on this cliffhanger.
","The console version of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is a real-time hack and slash/action role-playing game presented in a 3D perspective, with a rotatable isometric three-quarter top-down view.[7]
At the beginning of the game, character stats are preset, with the player able to choose from three race/class combinations; a dwarven fighter (Kromlech), a human archer (Vahn) or an elven sorceress (Adrianna).[11] The player can customize their character's stats through gaining experience points from defeating enemies. Every time the character increases in level, points are awarded corresponding to that level; i.e. if a character increases to level twelve, the player will gain twelve experience points to spend on the character's spells and feats.[12] For every four levels which the character increases, the player is given one ability point to spend on one of the six core attributes (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma).[13]
Each of the three characters have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. As Kromlech is a fighter, his spells and feats tend to focus on increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, such as the ability to swing his weapon in a circle or slam it into the ground to damage groups of nearby enemies. As Vahn relies on ranged attacks, his spells and feats tend to focus on increasing the power of his bow and granting him the ability to fire special types of arrows, such as exploding arrows, ice arrows or multiple arrows. As Adrianna is a sorceress, her spells and feats tend to focus on increasing the power of her magic and granting her numerous new spells, such as the ability to shoot ice or fire from her fingers, shoot a ball of lightning or call down meteors on her enemies.[14]
Gameplay is linear, and each main quest must be completed in sequence before the story can proceed, although there are some optional side-quests, which do not have to be completed immediately. However, all side-quests must be completed within the act in which they are assigned. There are relatively few NPCs in the game, with whom only those who are part of a quest or side-quest may be interacted. Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location at a time, and become increasingly expensive and more powerful as the game progresses. The HUD features the option to use either a transparent map that covers most of the screen, or a mini-map, with the player also given the option to turn the map off entirely.[15]
The game also features cooperative gameplay with another player. Both players share the same screen, and are thus limited in how far they can move away from one another. In co-op mode, the player who makes the kill gets 60% of the experience, and the other player gets 40%. Whichever player collects any gold drops gets 100% of the value, with the other player getting nothing.[13]
The game contains four difficulty levels; ""Easy"", ""Normal"", ""Hard"" and ""Extreme"". Extreme can only be unlocked after the player has beaten ""The Gauntlet"", a special mini-dungeon unlocked once the player completes the game on any difficulty level. The Gauntlet can only be played with Drizzt Do'Urden.[16] Extreme mode takes the form of a New Game Plus, and can only be played by importing a saved character from another game.[17] Once the player has completed Extreme mode, Drizzt Do'Urden becomes available to use in the main game.[18]
The Game Boy Advance version of Dark Alliance features some noticeable gameplay differences from the console versions.[19][20]

Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge,No,2003,Rare,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Like its Nintendo 64 (N64) predecessors Banjo-Kazooie (1998) and Banjo-Tooie (2000), Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge is an adventure platformer[2] with a strong emphasis on collecting items.[3] The player must control the player characters, the bear Banjo and his bird friend Kazooie, through several levels.[4] The story takes place between the events of the N64 Banjo games[5] and employs time travel as a key plot device.[3] In the story, the evil witch and antagonist of the previous games, Gruntilda, transfers her spirit into a mechanical body before kidnapping Kazooie and going back in time to prevent her from meeting Banjo, thus preventing the events of Banjo-Kazooie.[6] The shaman Mumbo Jumbo sends Banjo back in time to stop Gruntilda.[2] At the start of the game, the player controls just Banjo, who can walk, jump, crouch, and attack enemies with his backpack. Collecting golden musical notes scattered around levels will enable Banjo to purchase three additional abilities from a mole named Bozzeye. Eventually, Banjo rescues Kazooie, who rides in his backpack for the remainder of the game. With Kazooie, the player can purchase seven new abilities, such as temporary flight.[3] While Grunty's Revenge's game mechanics are largely the same as those from the N64 games, it is presented in 2D from an overhead perspective with pre-rendered graphics, rather than the 3D presentation of its predecessors.[2][6]
There are five levels (called worlds), which are accessed from the overworld Spiral Mountain.[2] In each world, players must collect items scattered around the environments. These include the musical notes; puzzle pieces called Jiggies, which unlock levels and progress players through the game; empty honeycombs, which extend Banjo's energy bar; and lost creatures called Jinjos, which will give the player a Jiggy when every one in a level is found.[4][6] Progress is tracked on a statistics screen showing maps of each location and collected items.[6][a] Other collectibles include totems and coins; overall, there are more than 750 collectibles.[3] If Banjo gives totems to Mumbo Jumbo, he will gain the ability to transform into other creatures, including a mouse, squid, candle, or tank, each with its own unique abilities.[3] Some areas in levels are inaccessible unless Banjo buys new abilities[6] or transformations.[3] Every level features an ""arena style"" boss fight with Gruntilda or her minion, Klungo.[2] The final boss fight is a game show-style quiz testing the player's knowledge of the game mechanics.[2][6] Aside from the platforming, some levels feature minigames,[6] such as fishing,[2] racing,[6] and target shooting.[3] The closing credits features a minigame where the player can earn tokens, which can be used to purchase and replay unlocked ones in an arcade cabinet hidden in one of the levels.[6]

Banjo-Pilot,Yes,2005,Rare,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Banjo-Pilot is a kart racing game featuring characters and environments from the Banjo-Kazooie series of platform games.[1][2] It plays similarly to the Mario Kart series by Nintendo:[3] the player, controlling a character in their vehicle, must race opponents around tracks. The player views the gameplay from behind the character's back, and must manoeuvre their character throughout the race. All races are three laps long and feature elements that confer advantages, such as offensive power-ups.[3][4] Collectible, golden music notes, an element from the Banjo platformers, are scattered around tracks as well.[2] Banjo-Pilot is distinguished from other kart racing games because the player controls airplanes instead of go-karts,[1] allowing them to move up and down.[4] However, the planes do exhibit behaviours normally associated with karts, such as slowing down over rough ground.[5] The planes are equipped with bullets that can be shot at other players; they can also do a barrel roll to avoid attacks from others.[5] The game features a total of nine player characters,[4] although only four are available at the start.[a][6]:12â13
The game features sixteen tracks accessible through four different game modes for a single-player.[6]:5[7] In Grand Prix, players race opponents through a series of four consecutive tracks and earn points based on their finishing position.[3] At the end of Grand Prix, players must participate in a Champion Challengeâan aerial dogfight against a boss.[2][3] Jiggy Challenge retains the emphasis on collecting items from the Banjo platformers: the player must look for and collect puzzle pieces called Jiggies for points while racing Bottles the mole.[2] Quickrace allows the player to choose from any of the game's tracks to race on, while time trial challenges players to finish a course in the fastest time possible.[6]:5 The game also features multiplayer modes for up to four players: a multiplayer version of Grand Prix, a one-on-one race, and a dogfighting game.[2] Competing in races will earn players pages of a book, which serve as a form of currency. How many they earn is based on their race placement and how many musical notes they collect. These pages can be given to the anthropomorphic book Cheato in exchange for various bonuses, such as new game modes and characters.[2]

Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus,,2005,WayForward,VU Games,"NA, PAL","On her birthday, Princess Annika worries her parents by going outside to ice skate without permission, and bringing home a ""possibly dangerous"" polar bear cub named Shiver. As a result, the overprotective King and Queen forbid her from going skating ever again.
Annoyed, Annika sneaks out to join a skating festival in the village that night. A powerful sorcerer named Wenlock appears, and orders the princess to marry him. The King and Queen arrive and confront Wenlock, but he laughs and cryptically reminds the king and queen of the fate of their ""other daughter"". When Annika refuses his proposal, Wenlock petrifies the entire village population, including Annika's parents. Annika is rescued by a winged horse named Brietta, but Wenlock warns her she has three days to marry him; otherwise, the spell will become permanent.
Brietta takes Annika to the Cloud Kingdom, ruled by Queen Rayla. Annika discovers that her parentsâ ""other daughter"" is, in fact, Brietta, who was transformed into a pegasus by Wenlock when she refused to marry him. This explains why their parents were so protective of Annika once she was born. The Cloud Queen tells Annika that the only thing that can defeat Wenlock is a ""Wand of Light""; built from a measure of courage, a ring of love, and a gem of ice lit by hope's eternal flame. Despite Briettaâs reluctance due to past failed attempts, Annika assures her that they can build the wand together.
Annika, Brietta, and Shiver travel to the Forbidden Forest, where they meet Aidan, a blacksmith. When Shiver falls into a giant's stew pot, Annika uses her hair ribbon  to help them escape. The ribbon, Annika's exact height, is the ""measure of courage"", and turns into a staff for the Wand of Light. After getting a map from the gem dealer Ferris, the group finds a large cavern filled with ice gems, where Annika and Aidan take one each. Aidan reveals that he ran away from his parents after he lost all of their money gambling. He took an extra gem to bring to his parents, so they would forgive him. Brietta offers her tiara for the ring of love. With all three objects, Aidan smiths the ""Wand of Light"" and Annika uses it to transform Brietta back into a human.
On their way back to the Cloud Kingdom, Annika and Brietta are pursued by Wenlock, and Brietta is knocked unconscious in the chase. Enraged, Annika orders the wand to destroy Wenlock, but it doesn't work. With no other options, she gives in and finally agrees to marry him. Wenlock refuses, calling her annoying, just like his former wives, all now cursed to become trolls. He takes the wand, and buries Annika in an avalanche.
Aidan helps dig Annika out. After she recuperates, the group sneaks into Wenlock's palace. Annika finds the wand, but it has been damaged and the gem breaks off and falls into the sea.  Aidan offers his gem as a replacement; realizing that the wand cannot be used for vengeance, Annika breaks all of Wenlock's spells for the love of her family and her people. Wenlock is stripped of his powers, his ex-wives are restored to their true forms, and the spell on Annika's kingdom is broken. Annika and Brietta are reunited with their parents, while Aidan reconciles with his father. In the Cloud Kingdom, Annika and Aidan skate together, while the Cloud Queen lifts the wand into the sky to become a star.

They discover a little girl and a chest of belongings washed up after a storm, and take her in and name her ""Ro"" after the only two letters left on her chests' nameplate. Ten years later, Ro has learned to speak to animals and grows up to be a beautiful young woman, spending her days playing on the island with Azul, Sagi, and a baby elephant named Tika.
Prince Antonio is out exploring the South Seas, and finds himself on Ro's Island. She saves him from a float of crocodiles, and Antonio invites her to return with him to his Kingdom of Apollonia, so she can search for clues as to her forgotten past. Ro agrees, bringing her three friends with her. On the journey, Ro and Antonio begin to fall in love.
In Apollonia, King Peter and Queen Danielle are shocked when they meet Ro. Peter had arranged a marriage for Antonio while he was away to force his son to settle down and stop adventuring. He takes an immediate dislike to the ""Wild Island Girl"" for disrupting his plans. However, Antonio's three little sisters, and Danielle's pet albino monkey Tallulah, immediately befriend Ro and her animals.
Antonio's betrothed, Princess Luciana, and her mother Queen Ariana arrive, so Antonio can meet them. Unbeknownst to everyone, even Luciana, Ariana's parents committed treason and were demoted to swineherds by Peter, long ago. Ariana married an elderly king to become queen and now is seeking a way to enact revenge on Peter; seeing Ro as a threat, she works to sabotage all Ro's attempts to fit in. However, Antonio falls more and more in love with Ro, and Luciana herself, being kindhearted, feels sorry for her.
Ro, demoralized by her 'failures', thinks about returning to the island. Tallulah, Sagi, Azul and Tika cheer her up and help her get dressed up for a royal ball. At the ball, everyone is impressed by Ro's beauty and grace, and Antonio privately proposes to her. However, Ro refuses, reminding Antonio his duty is to obey his father.
Antonio argues with Peter and eventually abdicates the crown to one of his younger sisters. He leaves a note for Ro to say he will run away with her. Tika, afraid to lose Ro, overhears and hides the note. Meanwhile, Ariana sends her pet rats to spread ""sunset herb"" through the kingdom. The poison causes all animals who ingest it to fall into a coma-like sleep. Azul is also fed some, and King Peter, concluding Ro's animals brought the disease, imprisons her.
Peter strikes a bargain with Antonio - he will free Ro if Antonio marries Luciana. Ro, Sagi, Tika and a sleeping Azul are sent off on a ship, and Tika, realizing her mistake, confesses to Ro about the note and is forgiven. A sailor, bribed by Ariana, knocks them all overboard. In the water, Ro remembers the shipwreck of her childhood, and that her real name is Rosella.
Returning to the Kingdom with the help of some dolphins, Ro learns from a little bird that Ariana put sunset herb in the wedding cake to kill Peter and Antonio. Ro makes an antidote to wake Azul, but is stopped by guards. Tika disrupts the wedding and gets Antonio to come to Ro's rescue, while Sagi takes the antidote to Tallulah, waking her. When Ro accuses Ariana, no one believes her, until Luciana, remembering her mother forbade her to eat anything after the wedding, defends Ro. Ariana flees in a carriage, but is wrecked and flung into a pigsty.
When Ro reveals to Antonio she has remembered her full name, a wedding guest, Queen Marissa of Paladia, comes forward saying she lost her daughter Rosella at sea many years ago. Ro and Marissa sing a lullaby from Ro's childhood together, confirming the truth of the story. Peter begs Ro's forgiveness and thanks her for saving their lives, and she and Antonio are married, while Luciana meets a handsome prince at the wedding. Ro and Antonio then sail off to find new adventures, with Tika, Sagi, Azul, and Tallulah in tow.

The princessesâ adventurous personalities and unique hobbies are considered improper by other members of the royal society. King Randolph summons his cousin, Duchess Rowena, to help educate the princesses in proper etiquette; the Duchess's strict rules and instruction begins to deject the princessesâ spirits.
On their youngest, triplet sistersâ birthday, Genevieve and the others gift them with a copy of their late mother's favorite story: a princess discovered a magical land where she danced for three nights before it vanished. Looking at each other's copies of the story, and the tiles on their bedroom floor, Genevieve discovers how to open a gateway into the magical land. Upon entering, they are taken to a grand pavilion where they dance the night away. While there, the princesses discover that the hanging golden flowers grant wishes, along with discovering the water has healing properties; the youngest princess, Lacey, takes some water in a vial.
The next day, the princesses appear tired and the duchess finds their new dancing shoes worn out, arousing her suspicion. King Randolph falls ill, so Genevieve asks the royal cobbler, Derek, to investigate Rowena's true intentions upon returning to the kingdom. That night, the princesses return to the magical land; meanwhile, Derek discovers that Rowena has been poisoning the King.
The next morning, the sisters are again exhausted. Rowena, refusing to believe the sisters when they tell her the truth, decides to force them into servitude. After mishearing their father talking about them to Rowena, the heartbroken princesses return to the magical land for a third time, and Rowena finds them missing the next morning.
Derek figures out how to enter the gateway and goes to report his findings to the sisters. Rowena learns how to enter the magic land from her monkey, Brutus, after he spies on Derek, and takes one of the wish-granting flowers. Despite knowing from the story that they'll never be able to return to the magic land after their third visit, the princesses decide to go home and help their father; however, they and Derek find themselves trapped as Rowena orders her footman, Desmond, to destroy the gateway in the princessesâ bedroom. The group manage to escape when Genevieve and Derek are able to open a different gateway by dancing together.
Once home, they find out that the King is dying and that Rowena has taken over as Queen. While the other princesses outsmart and distract the guards, Genevieve and Derek rush in to confront Rowena. The Duchess uses the golden flower to wish for Genevieve to dance forever, but Genevieve manages to blow the magic dust back at her with a fan, forcing Rowena to dance uncontrollably. When Desmond tries to help her, he is pulled into the spell, and the two dance their way out of the castle. Lacey uses the water she took from the magic land to revive her father. King Randolph apologizes for not seeing through Rowena, and realizes how truly special his daughters are. Soon after, Genevieve and Derek celebrate their wedding.

Barnyard NANickelodeon Barnyard PAL,,2006,Halfbrick Studios,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game has several types of gameplay, from missions to a mini-game type system. Players play through a sequence of nine chapters as farm animals of their choosing. An extra farm animal maybe be unlocked from having Nickelodeon games at the time that were included in the 'Crossover' event. As players progress through the chapters in the game, they meet new characters, unlock new areas, get more in-game currency, etc. Players travel around the Barnyard and either explore the area(s) the game has to offer or follow the story and complete the missions by going to the barn animal that sent a text to players' phones. Players may find these characters by looking for, and following the quickest path to, the '!' on the map. As players continue through the chapters, the game increases in variety. There are many references to the Barnyard as well, including dialogue from the characters and certain in-game objects. As players reach the mid-part of the game, however, they lose the same playable character, Ben, that is lost in the movie. As players reach the end of the game, specifically Chapter 8, things only get worse as the leader of the Barnyard, Otis, runs off and players are put in charge. However, the tides suddenly turn as the player, the other animals, and Otis take one final stand against the final boss. Note that the number of missions available depends on the chapter being played.
Within the game there is a storyline which fits the movie to some extent but still goes along its own path. Characters die and are introduced as the game progresses as in the movie. Missions fit the storyline of the game and the movie and vary a lot. A lot of missions once completed become minigames which the player can play again. Missions can be started by simply talking to the located characters. Most of the in-game missions are done during the day and must be done by the time the timer runs out, but some of them are nighttime missions that need to be completed by morning (or before the timer runs out).
Mini-games most often become available after completing missions, but may also become available in the barn. Missions include golf, or jumping and kicking a pipe at other characters to stay alive. Throughout the game, the player may notice that the difficulty of some of the mini-games increases as the story progresses. There are also variations of mini-games from previous chapters. One example being 'Tease The Mailman' and 'Tease Mrs. Beady'. The player could also buy some of the mini-games from the Gopher Underground Shop as some of them are located in the Night Barn. During gameplay, the player is eventually informed of the 'Barnyard Champion' title throughout. At the end of all the mini-games the player's performance is graded (Final Score). The grades range from an 'F' to a Star. Getting Stars is the key to getting Barnyard Champion. The player needs to talk to a character mentioned in the game that provides information on the standings for Barnyard Champion. While climbing to the top of the leaderboard, the player receives a Gold Rush Token for every move up. Once the player reaches #1, a special text is received, indicating that the player is now the Barnyard Champion. After the player receives this text and enters the Night Barn, a special cutscene plays.
During the day, the barn is a boring place where the player could acquire some resources for cooking, but at night, the barn becomes a lively place where the player could party, make Mocktails and play minigames. The barn is very customisable through the Gopher Underground Shop, a shop mentioned in an early Chapter 1 mission that is located just outside the main area. Upon reaching this point in the game, the player receives just enough Gopher Bucks for the only item available during the first visit. After this mission, all the other objects become unlocked except for the Neon Dance Floor. The player may then make additional purchases and do missions for the owner of the Gopher Underground Shop.
Within the game there are many forms of objects to collect:

The player controls Batman from a third-person perspective, who has access to several gadgets that can be put to good use during both combat and stealth segments. These include batarangs, smoke grenades, flash bang grenades, and an 'HF Transponder', which summons bats to gather around and incapacitate enemies with ""fear"" (a gameplay mechanic unique to this game). During stealth segments, the player can interact with the environment to create various circumstances that scare off enemies, such as explosions or dropping crates near them, making them easier to subdue. Fear also plays a role in the combat segments, where, if the fear bar is filled, it allows the player to finish off the last remaining enemy with a single hit. The overall stealth gameplay is reminiscent of the Splinter Cell series.
Aside from the combat and stealth segments, the game also incorporates several combat racing sections where the player drives the Tumbler. The game features several alternate costumes for Batman to wear, which are unlocked after completing the main story. Aside from the story, there is a ""Gallery of Fear"", where the player can view various enemies and villains they have encountered throughout the game and read their bios.

Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu,No,2003,Ubisoft,Ubisoft,,"On the anniversary of his parents', Thomas and Martha Wayne, murder, Batman takes a visit to Crime Alley to pay his respects to them, when he spots several civilians being kidnapped. After subduing the kidnappers, Batman learns of massive prison breakouts at both Arkham Asylum and Stonegate Prison. Commissioner James Gordon (Bob Hastings) contacts Batman to meet him at the courthouse, but is attacked by Scarecrow (Jeffrey Combs) and overcome by his fear gas. After defeating Scarecrow, Batman is informed by Gordon, who has recovered from the fear toxin's effects, that Scarecrow is not the only supervillain who has escaped, and sets out to find the others.
Eventually, Gordon notifies Batman of Clayface (Ron Perlman) having taken over the Gotham Chemical Factory. After defusing several bombs that were planted across the rooftops of Gotham City, Batman confronts Clayface, who reveals his plan to turn everyone in the city into clay creatures like himself and escapes. Batman follows him to the Chemical Factory, and along the way Gordon informs him of a weapon of mass destruction about to be brought in at the city docks. Batman eventually fights Clayface, who merges with other people like himself to grow larger, but is defeated by the Dark Knight using electricity.
During another conversation with Gordon, Batman deduces that the person responsible for the prison breakouts is Sin Tzu (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), a renowned warlord from Asia that was captured and sent to Arkham Asylum for further study. Sin Tzu intercepts the transmission and declares that Gotham will become a new stronghold for his empire once Batman is defeated. Gordon then tells Batman that the doomsday weapon has just arrived, so he intercepts the cargo ship carrying it and takes it to the Batcave, just as Sin Tzu predicted. Batman finds the doomsday weapon but is ambushed by Sin Tzu's men, who try to break into the Batcave. After stopping them, he attempts to disarm the weapon only to find that it is Bane (Hector Elizondo), another escaped supervillain, whom he defeats.
Batman eventually discovers that Sin Tzu is hiding at Arkham Asylum and, while Gordon orders the GCPD to surround the asylum to prevent his escape, Batman infiltrates Arkham through the sewer system. During his infiltration, Gordon warns Batman of Sin Tzu's mind-controlling powers, which he had used to manipulate Scarecrow, Clayface, and Bane into fighting him. After making his way past Sin Tzu's men and several inmates, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, who have been placed in suspended animation, Batman confronts Sin Tzu in a chamber in the lower levels of the asylum, resulting in the latter's defeat.
As dawn approaches, Gordon apologises to Batman for not telling him about Sin Tzu earlier, and explains that he had to keep his imprisonment at Arkham a secret for national security reasons, which the Dark Knight understands. As he retreats to look over Gotham City, Batman reminisces on the vows that have to be honored to the living and the dead, reminding himself of his parents' murder and how it inspired him to become the man he is today.
","Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu is a beat 'em up where players control either Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy), Batgirl (Tara Strong), Robin (Scott Menville), or Nightwing (Loren Lester). While it can be played solo, the game also features a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode. Players can unlock upgrades for their character, such as new fighting moves, by completing levels and advancing through the game's storyline.[5] There is also a challenge mode in which players (either cooperatively or competitively) take on groups of thugs without a storyline. The game features four difficulty levels: 'Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard', and 'Dark Knight', with the latter being an unlockable bonus.
The GameCube version includes support with the Game Boy Advance cable.

Batman: Vengeance,,2001,Ubisoft Montreal,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","Batman saves a woman named Mary Flynn from a bomb placed by the Joker at Gotham Chemicals, and learns that the villain is holding her son hostage for ransom. Using a transmitter, he tracks down the Joker and Mary to a partially demolished Gotham Bridge, where Mary is unmasked as Harley Quinn and the kidnapping scheme is revealed to be part of the Joker's plot to lure Batman into a trap. Batman ultimately defeats the Joker, but he falls off the bridge to his apparent death. Suspicious that the Joker survived, Batman lets Harley escape, as she is unaware that he still has the transmitter allowing him to monitor her activities.
While keeping tabs on Harley in the hopes of discovering the Joker's true plot, Batman and Batgirl they are alerted to Mr. Freeze attacking Gotham Industrial Research to kill scientist Isaac Evers, the creator of the miracle drug Promethium for cryogenically frozen people. Freeze had previously tried the drug on himself and his wife Nora, to no avail, and now seeks revenge against Evers, believing he sent him a tape with a promotional video on Promethium to taunt him. While pursuing Freeze, Batman uncovers Evers's shady dealings with the Joker, who funded his research after his initial funding was cut because of Promethium's high flammability. Shortly after saving Evers and defeating Freeze, Batman stumbles upon another sinister scheme, orchestrated by Poison Ivy. With Batgirl's help, he discovers Ivy created a new species of super-plants infested with deadly worms, and tracks her down to the rebuilt Gotham Chemicals building. There, he finds Mayor Hamilton Hill, who reveals the full extent of Ivy's plans: to blackmail him and other wealthy socialites by poisoning them with her worm-infected plants, which were apparently created from a chemical of mysterious origins. He also reveals that Ivy rebuilt Gotham Chemicals to mass-produce the chemical and infect more victims. Batman eventually defeats Ivy and obtains an antidote that can be used to save all her victims. 
Later, Batman spots some the Joker's goons hijacking a blimp, and goes to speak with Harley, who reveals that, since the Joker's death, some of his men have been operating on their own and recently left with the Joker's explosive ""toys"" and the blueprints to the Gotham Gasworks. After foiling the goons' plan to send the toys into the city's pipe network, Batman finds a tied up Issac Evers, who admits to hiring the Joker's goons to destroy Gotham Industrial for the insurance money, having been unable to collect on the damage left by Mr. Freeze without revealing his deals with the Joker. However, the goons eventually turned on him and tied him up in order to carry out their own plan to destroy Gotham City. As Batman hands Evers over to the police, Commissioner Gordon is hit with a Batarang. Blamed for the attack, Batman escapes from the police, and concludes that Harley is behind everything that has occurred since Jokerâs 'death'. After disguising himself as a drifter to avoid police attention, he investigates the Joker's old hideout and finds evidence hinting at his survival.
After tracking the stolen blimp to the Gasworks, Batman confronts a still-living Joker, who confirms his suspicions that he had faked his death to exact his true plan in a silent fashion. However, he further reveals that he manipulated everyone recently encountered by Batman into unknowingly helping it come to fruition: he funded Evers's research in exchange for large quantities of Promethium to make his Joker toxin flammable; he sent Mr. Freeze the promotional tape, knowing it would provoke him into attacking Evers, who in turn would later plan the insurance fraud scheme; he gave Poison Ivy the chemical to create her super-plants, so that she would eventually rebuid Gotham Chemicals, allowing the Joker to then mass-produce his toxin; and he had Harely give Batman false leads regarding the Joker's true motives, but lead him to Freeze, Ivy, and Evers's schemes, so that he could thwart them before they succeeded. Finally, Batman himself unwittingly contributed to the success of the Joker's plan: by flooding Gotham's pipe network when foiling the Gasworks scheme, he gave the Joker an opportunity to spread his now highly flammable toxin through the city and burn it to the ground. The Joker then attempts to escape in the blimp and spread his toxin, but Batman, after defeating his goons and subduing Harley, fights aboard and manages to thwart his plan by stopping the flow of Promethium and Joker toxin. As a backup plan, the Joker tries to crash the blimp and manually detonate the Promethium, but Batman destroys the blimp before he gets the chance, and saves the Joker from falling to his death. 
As all the villains are locked up at Arkham Asylum, Batman meets with Gordon, who apologises for sending the police after him, as he discovered Harley framed him, and thanks him for saving Gotham yet again. The Dark Knight then retreats to look out over the city, when the Bat-Signal ignites behind him.

The Bee Game|Die Biene Maja: Klatschmohnwiese in Gefahr PAL,,2007,Independent Arts,Midway,"NA, PAL","Bonsels' original book contains fewer than 200 pages. The storyline is centered on the relation of Maya and her many adventures.
Maya is a bee born in a bee hive during internal unrest: the hive is dividing itself into two new colonies. Maya is raised by her teacher, Mrs. Cassandra. Despite Mrs. Cassandra's warnings, Maya wants to explore the wide world and commits the unforgivable crime of leaving the hive. During her adventures, Maya, now in exile, befriends other insects and braves dangers with them. In the climax of the book, Maya is taken prisoner by hornets, the bees' sworn enemies.
Prisoner of the hornets, Maya learns of a hornet plan to attack her native hive. Maya is faced with the decision to either return to hive and suffer her due punishment, saving the hive, or leaving the plan unannounced, saving herself but destroying the hive. After severe pondering, she makes the decision to return. In the hive, she announces the coming attack and is, totally unexpectedly, pardoned. The forewarned bees triumph over the hornet attack force. Maya, now a heroine of the hive, becomes a teacher like Mrs. Cassandra and shares her experiences and wisdom with the future generation.
It has been suggested[by whom?] that the book may have carried a political message, analogous to Jean de La Fontaine's or Ivan Krylov's work. According to this view, Maya represents the ideal citizen, and the beehive represents a well-organised militarist society. It has also elements of nationalism and speciesism. Maya gets angry in two instances. First, a grasshopper fails to distinguish between bees and wasps. Maya's verbal response includes calling the wasps ""a useless gang of bandits"" [RÃ¤ubergeschlecht] that have no ""home or faith"" [Heimat und Glauben]. Second, a fly calls Maya an idiot, which prompts Maya to shout that she's going to teach ""respect for bees"" and to threaten the fly with her stinger. The critic[who?] interprets this to mean that respect is based on the threat of violence. Collectivism versus individualism is also a theme. Maya's independence and departure from the beehive is seen as reproachable, but it is atoned by her warning of the hornets' attack. This show of loyalty restores her position in the society. In the hornet attack part of the story, the bees' will to defend the hive and the heroic deaths of bee officers are glorified, often in overtly militarist tones.[8]
In the post-WWII adaptations, the militarist element was toned down considerably, the hornets' role reduced, and the character of Willy, a lazy and quite un-warlike drone bee, was introduced (he does not appear in the novel). In the cartoon series, the briskly marching, but ridiculously incompetent ant armies provide a parody of militarism.

Big Mutha Truckers,No,2005,Raylight Studios,Destination GamesNAZoo Digital PublishingPAL,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Big Mutha Truckers is primarily a racing game, in the same vein as 18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker. Players spend the majority of their time on the road, navigating the highways between the game's six cities: Salt Sea City, Capital City, Greenback, Skeeter's Creek, Smokestack Heights, and Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated. The player will earn most of their money through trade, shipping goods from cell phones to beer, with additional opportunities from mini-games and challenge races.
Every city features three locations: a garage, a bar, and a store. The garage allowed players to repair damage, refuel, switch trailers to carry different kinds of cargo, buy upgrades to improve their rig, or design custom logos for their truck. In the bar the player can find tips on where to buy and sell certain cargo, and a loan shark. The store allows the player to buy and sell goods, with prices varying by town. When visiting Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated, the bar and store are replaced by visits to Ma Jackson.
On the road, the player can earn extra money by smashing other vehicles. This money can be multiplied through combos, or by hitting a vehicle with the trailer. If the player earns a high enough combo, he can make reward icons appear on the road. When collected, these icons can refuel the truck, repair damage, or offer a cash bonus. Law enforcement and biker gangs are both present in the game, and cause trouble for the player if they attack them by mistake. Any cop will pursue and capture a player, while bikers will attempt to shoot up the trailer, or even detach it from the truck. In either case, it is a significant blow to the player's cash. Every cop can be avoided with skillful driving, and bikers can be shaken away from the truck.
Occasionally, the player will be asked to accomplish a side-mission when they visit a bar. These point-to-point races are good for cash if the player can complete them.

Bionicle Heroes,,2006,Amaze Entertainment,Eidos Interactive,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The home console version of Bionicle Heroes is a single-player third-person shooter. The game is split up into six different elementally-themed worlds as well as a central hub world where the player can purchase upgrades and bonus content.[1] After defeating a Piraka at the end of a world, they move to the Piraka Playground in the hub world. The player can use their collected Lego pieces to purchase comical cutscenes of the villains engaging in ""tomfoolery"".[2] Three bonus levels are also unlockable, functioning as score challenges where the goal is to defeat as many enemies as possible.[2] The game features 100 collectibles to collect, and each level also contains silver and gold canisters that unlock new items in the hub world's trophy cave.[3] Completed levels can be revisited in a free play mode, where the player can find additional items and collectibles.[3]
On most versions of the game, the player controls the playable Toa character using a controller. On the Nintendo Wii version of the game, control of the camera is instead accomplished through the Wii Remote's IR sensor.[4] The player begins each level with a single mask, with additional ones scattered throughout the level. These masks provide the player with a variety of weapons and abilities, ranging from sniper rifles to shotguns. The active mask can be togged between by the player at any point.[1] If a player's health is reduced to zero, they lose the mask they were wearing.[3] The player can interact with the environment, performing actions similar to how the Force operates in the Lego Star Wars games.[2]
Defeating enemies scatters them into Lego pieces, which can be collected and used in the hub world. Additionally, collecting them adds to the in-game Hero Mode gauge, which activates when completely filled. While in Hero Mode, the player becomes invincible to any damage.[2] This lasts until the player reaches a set point in the level that requires the player use up their Hero Mode charge to activate objects used to progress throughout the level.[1] Hero Mode is also used in boss battles, with the player targeting smaller enemies to build up the gauge to activate a powerful attack against the boss.[1] The game uses an auto-targeting feature that automatically locks in to enemies. This feature only works at certain distances, and will not activate if the player is too close or too far away from an enemy.[1]
The Nintendo DS version of Bionicle Heroes is a first-person shooter.[5][6] Like other DS first-person shooters, the game can be controlled entirely with buttons or with a mix of button and touchscreen controls,[5] with the directional pad being used to walk and the touchscreen being used to aim.[6] Defeating enemies results in them crumbling into bricks.[6] These bricks can be used to fill the player's Hero Mode charge meter. When filled, the player's gains temporary invincibility and a boost to the power of weapons.[7] The game features two modes: a single-player campaign and an offline multiplayer mode.[5][6]
The single-player mode's world is divided into six different areas, with a Piraka boss battle at the end of each world.[5] From the beginning, the player has access to the Zamor Launcher - a weak weapon with unlimited ammunition - but by collecting different masks scattered throughout each area, the player gains permanent access to new weapons, each with different traits. Each world features three versions of mask, with the second and third providing an upgrade to the weapon.[5] In addition to weaponry, each mask also offers a unique ability like higher jumping, immunity to lava, or the ability to break boulders.[6] Runes are scattered throughout the worlds, which grant access to cheats.[6]
The multiplayer mode can only be accessed with other consoles that also have a copy of Bionicle Heroes. The multiplayer deathmatch mode pits players against each other in an arena, similar to the ones used in boss battles in the single-player mode. The arenas have multiple tiers, and masks are scattered throughout the arena. Collecting them grants temporary access to a weapon.[6]
The Game Boy Advance version of Bionicle Heroes is a run 'n' gun shoot 'em up game.[8][9] The player, controlling a Toa, can move in eight directions as well as strafe.[8] Two types of gunfire can be selected from; by pressing the A button they can fire a weaker, rapid-fire blast, while pressing the B button results in more concentrated attacks.[8][9] The exact attack assigned to the B button is determined by which mask the player is wearing and varies from ""tight, focused laser beams to slow, exploding mortar rounds"".[9]
There are six different types of masks available in the game, and these masks are scattered throughout each level.[10] The game features 19 levels,[8] and previously cleared levels are unlocked in a free play mode where weapons can be switched between at will.[9] Each level features collectible runes, which can be traded in for cheats and unlock able mini-games.[8] Replaying levels is necessary to unlock everything available in the game.[8] After completing each region, the player battles one of the six Piraka.[9][10]
The mobile phone version of Bionicle Heroes is a top-down, 2D action-adventure game. The player can find masks throughout the levels, granting them the powers of the Toa. The masks possess the powers of the four classical elements, allowing the player unique abilities. Occasionally, combinations of the four elements will be needed to advance in the game.[11]

Black Matrix Zero,No,2002,Flight-Plan,NEC Interchannel,JP,NaN,"Black/Matrix gives the player control of a group of playable characters who traverse various two-dimensional 3/4 isometric-view maps that represent towns and battlefields.[5] The flow of gameplay cycles between expository cut scenes revealing the plot, towns and menus for procurement and management of items and equipment, and battles which pit the playable characters against computer controlled opponents in battle maps. Progression through Black/Matrix is plot-driven, and the player has limited influence on the overall course of the game - evidenced by the absence of an overworld map mode.
The gameplay in Black/Matrix is broken into chapters based on plot themes,[6] and the plot is delivered in fully voiced cut scenes that begin and conclude each chapter, as well as precede and follow each battle. The visual style of the cut scenes varies based on version; Black/Matrix and Black/Matrix + use the same graphical style seen in town and battlefield maps, while Black/Matrix AD employs visual novel style static landscapes with large character sprites superimposed over them.[2] Regardless of form these scenes announce events such as the addition of new playable characters, and occasionally offer the player opportunities to recruit optional characters such as white-wing slaves and, depending on the version, unused master characters.
Battles are organized into turns which alternate between the player and the computer. During the player turn any player-controlled character can perform actions in any order, with a maximum of three actions per character per turn. Every character can use the actions ""move"", ""attack"", and ""item"", though depending on the character and the point in the game, they may have others actions as well. The move action allows a character to travel on the map; battlefield maps are composed of square tiles[2] and the number of tiles in a given character's range is determined by their statistics. Characters have a single preset attack technique and can equip any type of weapon appropriate to that technique; for example, a character with the ""stab"" attack type can equip rapiers, spears, and staffs. Additionally, characters automatically respond by counterattacking, defending, or attempting to dodge when they are attacked; the player can switch the response at any time through the ""Waiting Stance"" command.[7]
Specific, plot-determined characters have access to the ""magic"" command at all times, while others require special equipment to unlock it. Spell effectiveness varies from turn to turn, as governed by a ""Biorhythm"" clock.[7] In place of conventional magic points to manage magic use, Black/Matrix uses a system called ""Blood Points"". Blood Points can be distributed to individual playable characters before battles to expend in spell casting.[4] Blood points are accrued by attacking the prostrate bodies of defeated enemies, effectively killing them.[4] (Some fallen playable characters are susceptible to the same fate, after which they are lost permanently.)[7] Additionally, the player can infuse a weapon with Blood Points to improve its effectiveness and possibly unlock a special attack[6] called a ""latent ability"". Latent abilities function like spells in that they cost Blood Points to use and add various effects to the damage dealt by the weapon.
At the conclusion of each battle the game evaluates the player's performance and assigns a letter grade-based rank, which determines the value of bonus items and the amounts of money and experience points the player is awarded. Experience points go into a common pool and the player distributes it to the characters at will, choosing which characters gain experience levels.[6] Upon level-up, the player also determines how a given character's statistics mature, allowing for customization.[4]
Abel (ã¢ãã«, Aberu) (Hiroshi Kamiya), is the amnesiac silent protagonist of Black/Matrix - his dialog is not shown on screen. A white-wing slave, he is locked in Golgoda Prison for the crime of love. He exhibits a power to transform black-wings into white-wings, which marks him as the 'messiah'.
Black/Matrix begins with the player choosing a black-wing 'master', i.e. companion, for Abel,[6] which affects the beginning and ending of the game. The choices are: 
There is an additional secret male master, Zero (ã¼ã­, Zero) (Kentarou Itou), who becomes available after inputting a code (which differs in each release).[7]
Leburobus (ã¬ãã­ãã¹, Reburobusu) (Hideyuki Hori) is a white-wing criminal. He was once a gladiator, but was sent to Golgoda Prison for killing his former masters. He is very tough and uses swords and other heavy weapons. He seeks ""freedom"", and joins Abel's escape.
Gaius (ã¬ã¤ã¦ã¹, Gaiusu) (Kaneto Shiozawa) is a white-wing criminal. He gained fame as ""Gaius the Gale"" for stealing from the rich to give to the poor, but is later imprisoned for the crime of ""hypocrisy"" as a result. He joins Abel's escape.
Phillipo (ããªã, Piripo) (Hiro Yuuki) is a blond-haired boy whom Abel encounters in Golgoda Prison at the beginning of the game. Though he is a black-wing, he is shunned because of his weakness. He escapes with the party and becomes an archer.
Johannes (John) (ã¨ãã, Yohane) (Takeshi Aono) is the black-wing former high priest of the Temple of the Sun who lost his position after a power-struggle. He is a necromancer who can use magic to revive dead characters as zombie decoys. After witnessing Abel's mysterious powers, he joins the group.
RupiRupi (ã«ãã«ã, Rupirupi) (Kikuko Inoue) is a black-wing former student of Johannes who took over his research, eventually becoming a Demon Knight.[7] She casts powerful healing spells. Her hobby is writing in a ""revenge diary"".
Marco (ãã«ã³, Maruko) (Ai Orikasa), a white-wing, is known as the ""Miracle Boy"" for becoming the first person to don an Arch-demon Armor. Despite his youthful looks, he is the leader of a white-wing liberation movement.
On release, Famitsu magazine scored the Dreamcast version of the game a 30 out of 40.[8]

Blackthorne,,2003,Mass Media Inc.,Blizzard Classic Arcade,"NA, PAL","Blackthorne is set on the planet Tuul, which has existed for centuries without human knowledge. All of this time, Tuul's people have been ruled over by a single shaman who ""was blessed with all knowledge"". Years before the game begins, Thoros, the latest ruler, finds it near impossible to choose between his two sons as the next ruler. Believing it will solve the dilemma, he leads them to the deserts and kills himself. His body becomes two stones, light and dark, and he gives one to each boy to rule their own kingdoms respectively. The people of the lightstone form the kingdom of Androth, and the people of the darkstone form Ka'dra'suul. But while Androth respects their stone, Ka'dra'suul reject theirs, and are eventually transformed into monsters by it. In this time, a ka'dra named Sarlac seizes power. He forms an army and leads them against Androth. Knowing of his people's doom, the ruler of Androth, King Vlaros, with the aid of the Androthi magician Galadril, sends his son Kyle to Earth to save his life. Vlaros also gives Kyle the lightstone for safe keeping.
Twenty years later, Kyle has become a renowned military captain and mercenary. After breaking out of prison facing court martial, Kyle begins having strange dreams, and is eventually confronted by Galadril. He is told that it is time to return to Tuul and save his people. The game begins here with Kyle setting out to kill Sarlac and reclaim his throne.
Kyle ventures through the land fighting his way to Sarlac's castle. He confronts Sarlac and threatens to keep his skull as a mounted trophy on his wall. The two battle and Kyle is the victor. He avenges his father, King Vlaros. Kyle then becomes king of Androth, where it is stated that he ruled justly, fairly and with honor for many years. The final shot of the game shows him sitting on the throne with a woman sitting next to him. Sarlac's skull is seen mounted on the wall as a trophy, just as Kyle had promised.
","The game focuses around protagonist Kyle ""Blackthorne"" Vlaros, out for revenge on Sarlac and his minions. The gameplay involves large platforming sequences, in which Kyle can run and climb around the environment, find keys and items and progress to the end of each maze like level. Combat in Blackthorne takes the form of gunfights. Both Blackthorne and his enemies can press against walls to avoid incoming bullets. Blackthorne can also fire blindly behind himself. During the game, Kyle uses a pump action shotgun as his primary weapon. As the game progresses, Androthi allies will help him upgrade the weapon, increasing its speed and power.
The game has seventeen levels within four areasâthe mines of Androth, the Karrellian forests/swamps, the Wasteland desert and Shadow keep. The Sega 32X version includes a fifth area, the snowy mountains, which is not found in the other versions of the game. As the game progresses through these areas, Kyle becomes stronger and better armed, but so do the enemies.

Blender Bros.,Yes (SPM),2002,A.I.,Infogrames,,"The player is Blender, a futuristic dog-like animal and the fearless leader of the Cosmo Keepers. He is determined to save the galaxy from the evil, even from the cute Zooligans. He has a huge set of ears that he can use for sonar (for figuring out where to go in a level), to fly for a short period of time, or to hit enemies with his signature spin move.
In the game, he uses Mini Bros. to help him. They all have special abilities that vary. Some can be used for lighting dark areas, some can heal Blender's life, and some do other things.
","Blender performs most of his attacks using his ears, generally using the B button depending on context. Pressing down in midair, or pressing A to jump from the crouch position, will cause Blender to flip upside-down and perform a high jump. Pressing B while doing a high jump causes Blender to perform a ""downward attack"" resembling a drill. Blender can also charge his B spin, to perform a ""spin wave"". The spin wave is Blender's longest range attack, not including the extra attack range given by equipping Nuckle (the default Bro that you start the game with).
The levels are nonlinear, and focus on puzzle-solving and dexterity rather than speed (though the levels are timed, and you can track your times for each level). One unique aspect of the levels is the ability to interact with the background. Most levels consist of two layers - a front area and a back area - that you can periodically move between. When you are in the front area, enemies and switches can be seen in the back area, forewarning you about the next part of the level. If you have access to a cosmo ball (a red ball that Blender can throw to kill enemies or hit switches), you can throw it upward to hit objects in the back area, allowing you to eliminate enemies before having to cross paths with them. 
The total game consists of seven worlds - Oasis, Diva, Earth, Shelltarl, Cosmo Heaven, Fo9, and Millitar. With the exception of Shelltarl, which is a single long level, each world is divided into three main stages, followed by a boss. [1] Oasis is the only world unlocked at first. You also have access to Cosmo Heaven, but only as a hub at first. After beating Oasis, you unlock Diva and Shelltarl. After beating those, Earth and Fo9 are unlocked. Beating these unlocks Millitar. Upon completing Millitar, Cosmo Heaven is invaded by the Zooligans, turning it into the final world of the game.
Throughout the game, you can collect different Bros. Bros are familiars that give you particular abilities. Nuckle, the Bro you start out with, gives you extra range for your primary attack. Some Bros can also be evolved when you play the right music for them. The records to play this music are available in the shop for ten bones apiece (bones being the currency of the game).

Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand|Bokura no TaiyÅJP,,"2003JP, NA 2004PAL",Hideo Kojima Production,Konami,"NA, PAL, JP","The game's story takes place in a time period near the end of the world, called the Age of Darkness.[1] The story features the appearance of undead creatures after the natural cycle of life and death was broken. People quickly began dying due to the use and misuse of ""Dark Matter"", a type of energy that corrupts and destroys life. Those who survived quickly became prey to dark creatures called ""Immortals"", beings composed of Dark Matter at the cellular level.
The story is set in the city of San Miguel, which had already been overrun by the Immortals. The city was in a hopeless situation as the curse brought the ""undeadening"" of all, edging the human race closer to extinction. Even the hero who used to hunt the Immortals has already fallen, and so people's hopes have been shattered.
One day, however, a mysterious boy named Django emerged. He turned out to have the blood of one of the most legendary vampire hunters running in his veins, and was also the heir of the Gun Del Sol. He must go to Istrakan, the City of DeathÂ â where many times and places intertwineÂ â in order to prevent the end of the world.
Django's mission to save humanity is reinforced by his desire to avenge his father, Ringo, after his death. He uses sunlight as his weapon throughout his endeavors.
","The game's cartridge has a photometric light sensor which measures light exposure. In order to charge the in-game solar weapons, the player must take their Game Boy Advance (GBA) outside in the daytime (as verified by the light sensor). If the player's gun battery runs out of light reserves and there is no sunlight available, then the player must avoid conflicts with enemies or find an in-game ""Solar Station"" to recharge.
Before a game is started, the player is prompted to set their current time and time zone. The game can then estimate when the sun will rise and set, and simulates the position of the sun inside the game. The player has an advantage during the daytime as vampires cannot be exposed to sunlight. Sunlight also affects the world around the main character - an example is a Solar Tree, a tree that is being damaged by the darkness of the Immortals, and can be cured by playing the game in the sunlight. The outdoor game environment also includes bird chirp sound effects in the morning and a soft orange glow around sunset.
Game combat focuses on stealth. An integral concept is shooting an undead in the back, stunning it, then either running away or killing it. Getting caught by a monster, indicated by a red exclamation point above the head, will reduce the grade received at the end of a stage. A number of other factors also determine the grade received, such as total time taken to complete the level. After a number of dungeon levels the player will reach an ""Immortal"" level where one of four bosses resides. The player will have to fight their way to the boss creature, or Immortal, and defeat it. The boss is then faced again in the sunlight outside of its lair. In this fight, a weapon called the ""Pile Driver"" must be charged by the player exposing the game to sunlight. The greater the amount of sunlight, the more damage the Pile Driver will inflict upon the Immortal during the fight.

Unarmed, he makes his way through the dungeon and is greeted by Zazie the Sunflower girl. She bestows upon him the Sol de Vice (Solar Glove), which gives Django the ability to enchant ordinary weapons, like a sword, with the power of the sun.
He arrives at what is left of San Miguel. Upon arriving he finds out that the vampire who stole the Gun Del Sol has been through here. He hears that Smith, the town blacksmith, is missing. He decides to go find Smith in hope of finding out something about the vampire. He is told by Zazie that she saw Smith head towards the cathedral. Django decides that was the best place to start looking for him. The story evolves from here into something much larger.
Towards the end of the game, Django will regain his Solar Gun; however, it will be greatly damaged due to the use of it by the vampire otherwise known as Ringo. Although the character known as Smith will repair it, it is unable to be restored to its original functionality.
If the player chooses to continue their game after beating the game, he or she will start off from where the game was last saved, rather than how the continue function worked in Boktai 1, where the player needed to restart the game. There are four different endings that are somewhat the same, other than the characters who are talking with Django, who basically talk about dark and light needing to be together in order for both to co-exist, and who, exactly, helped Django during the final battle. The characters include Earthly Maiden Lita, Dark Boy Sabata, the librarian named Lady, and Smith's granddaughter named Violet (Sumire in Japan).
The paths to each ending is dependent on the number of times the player has defeated the final boss, the Doomsday Beast Jormungandr. After defeat him the first time, the player will talk with Zazie. After Jormungandr's first defeat, the player cannot fight him again until the Megaman (Rockman) side-quest has been completed with Shademan. When that's completed and Jormungandr is defeated again, the player will talk to Violet again. When Jormungandr is defeated for the third time, the player will get to talk to Sabata. Defeat Jormungandr again, and the player will talk with Lady. One last time, and the player will talk with Lita. The cycle then repeats itself when defeating Jormungandr.
There are a total of two bad endings. The first bad ending is in the Spiral Tower while Django and Sabata are talking to the Black Dainn. Dainn will tell Django to become their ""Dark Sun,"" and a choice will be appear reading âJoin Black Dainnâ or âRefuse!!â Choosing to âJoin Black Dainnâ will result in a short cut scene and then the credits. The second bad ending takes place after fighting the Ancestor Piece Jormungandr. If the player fails to solar charge enough energy within the ten second time limit, Jormungandr will swallow Django and the player will fail to seal the Doomsday Beast.
There are a number of new characters added in this installment of the series. Kid, who runs the potion/armour shop, is met at a certain point in that game. Lady runs the library, serves as a guild master, and is also a tarot master. Cheyenne the Wind Warrior runs the weapon shop once the player defeats him in combat. A grim man runs a coffin shop with many specialty coffins. Also, Solid Snake (from the Metal Gear series) makes a cameo asÂ ???.
Older characters such as Master Otenko, Sabata, and Lita (who happens to run the item shop) return as well. However, Lita's function has changed somewhat; in addition to tending the solar tree, she now sells fruit, eliminating the need to grow them like in the first game. Her prices depend on how much solar energy was collected the previous day.
","Boktai 2's gameplay is largely identical to that of the original, consisting of a series of stealth- and puzzle-oriented dungeons ending in boss battles against vampires with role-playing game elements. Additions include new weapons, the ability to forge weapons, a money system, and various subtle alterations. The sunlight is no longer used just for energy, but also as a form of currency called SOLL, which is good all over San Miguel. As the player plays the game in daylight, the player builds Solar Energy, or SOL, in the solar stations scattered throughout the in-game world. By converting SOL to SOLL via the local bank (where SOLL is stored and can gain interest) with a 1 SOL=1 SOLL conversion rate, energy can be turned into cash. This cash can be used to buy weapons or other various items. SOLL is also used to purchase a life when the player dies and wishes to continue. The player can get SOLL by selling unneeded items. SOLL can also be converted back to SOL when needed, so one can get energy, make it cash, buy things, and convert leftover SOLL to SOL.
Unlike in the first game, the player does not start over from the beginning of the game after finishing it. The player resumes the file in the last area. Like the first game, this one has a minigame that can be unlocked by completing the game twice. The player can gain access to this minigame by talking to Nero the cat (Kuro in the original Japanese version) or completing the game an even number of times. Prizes for high scores include photos and healing items.
Boktai featured a level named the ""Azure Sky Tower"" which presented a formidable challenge to players who have completed the game or were highly skilled. Boktai 2's equivalent is named Dream Avenue. Progress through the level yields Tarot cards, Bearnuts, Sunny Clogs and more. Completing the Avenue nets the player a prize, with quality of the prize based upon the difficulty of the challenge. There is also a Battle Arena to test the player's skills in a boss rush-type mode. There are four difficulty levels to the arena: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The player gets a special item for completing each difficulty level, usually an accessible photograph of one of the game's main characters.
The player has access to various missions from different characters after Lady returns to the library. There are four levels and three missions for each area. The player will be awarded for completing each mission. The player will get a tarot card or armor upon completing the first This game also features both new and old enemies. Some enemies include crows, centipede, bandits, grave keepers, hellhounds, bees, bats, spiders, serpents, skeletons, mummies, and liches. There are also crimson enemies. Crimson enemies appear after killing the hundredth enemy of the same kind. Crimson enemies drop rare items and give many EXP (experience points), but have much more Life and Attack.
This game contains a new feature called solar forging, available after the player has completed the cathedral stage and rescued Smith. With Solar Forging, any two weapon can be combined into one. Two weapons of the same name will produce another of the same name, which is useful for creating SP weapons later on in the game. (i.e. blood sword and blood sword = blood sword SP (when done properly), long sword and long sword = long sword SP). A combination of two weapons of the same type will give another weapon of that type, while weapons of two different types will yield one of the third types (for example, a sword with a sword will always give combined into a sword and a sword with a spear will always be combined into a hammer).

In order to score (in multiplayer mode), players must lay time bombs in order to trap and obliterate their opponents, with the last player alive becoming the winner. As the player defeats enemies and clears away obstacles, a variety of power-up tiles appear. Randomly selected from a pool of 10 different items, these tiles have a number of effects, such as increasing bombs' blast radius, increasing the player's bomb capacity, or even reversing a player's controls.
Unlike other Bomberman games, Tournament's single-player quest mode is an action-adventure game with influences of Zelda, PokÃ©mon and especially Hudson's Neutopia.
The majority of the action takes place in 2D from a top-down vantage point, while Karabon battles and select minigames are presented in a side view. Each of the game's six different environments possesses only a minimum of rectangular features and is detailed with all sorts of wacky nuances, such as trees that topple over or an earthen giant collapsed in the middle of a road.

Additional points are given for bonus words displayed in the game; additional bonus words formed during a single game produce increasing bonus values. In some versions one can also collect and complete ""books"" which are groups of words in a similar category. Once one completes the first of any of these words in a particular category it unlocks the book, and displays a complete list of the words needed to complete the book and get bonus points.

The player can explore 4 different locations; Stylesville (where the Bratz live), London, Paris, and the mansion. The objectives of the game are triggered when the player takes the correct Bratz girl to a speech bubble. During the game, coins called blings appear, which are coins for the Bratz girls.

Each character hails from a different clan made up of anthropomorphic animal-like beings or humans with fantastic powers, with their assortment of magic spells and personal field abilities that can be used out of battle to help the player progress through the game and find hidden items.[8]The main character is a young man named Ryu, one of the last surviving members of the Light Dragon Clan, who have been driven to near-extinction by their enemy, the Dark Dragon Clan. When his sister, Sara, is captured by the Dark Dragons, Ryu must travel the world searching for a way to get her back, as well as unlock his latent ability to transform into powerful dragons. During gameplay, the player can meet and recruit seven additional party members, including Nina, princess of the Kingdom of Windia whose race can transform into large birds; Bo (Gilliam in the Japanese version),[10] a wolf-man held prisoner by the Dark Dragons after they attacked his homeland; Karn (Danc in the Japanese version),[10] member of an ancient order of thieves with the ability to merge two or more party members together to create powerful fighters; Gobi (Manillo in the Japanese version),[10] a fish-man and traveling merchant who can transform into a giant fish; Ox (Builder in the Japanese version),[10] a large ox-man from a town of blacksmiths; Mogu, a mole-person with the ability to dig holes in certain areas; and Bleu (Deis in the Japanese version),[10] an immortal sorceress with a snake-like lower body who commands powerful magic.[6]
The principal antagonists are the Dark Dragon Clan, a militaristic empire made up of soldiers that can transform into dragons. They are led by Emperor Zog (Zorgon in the Japanese version), who seeks to take over the world by gaining the power of the Goddess Tyr (Myria in the Japanese version as well as the English version of the third game), who was sealed away centuries ago by the Light Dragons using six magic keys that have been scattered across the world.[11] His main general is Jade (Judas in the Japanese version), who in turn commands his Four Devas: Cort (Kyura in the Japanese version), a mad scientist; Mote (Sigmund in the Japanese version), a wizard who has the power to terrorize people in their dreams; Cerl (Carla in the Japanese version), a half-breed magic user who resents her past mistreatment by humans; and Goda, an armored goliath.
Breath of Fire takes place in an unnamed medieval world. In addition to ordinary humans, it is populated by various ""clans"" of anthropomorphic animals. The Dragon Clanâa race of humans who are able to transform into dragonsâdiffer from the others in that their members appear (for the most part) to be human. The back-story of the game is summarized during its prologue: Thousands of years ago, a goddess named Myria (also known as ""Tyr"" and ""Maria"" in some English translations and ""Miria"" in Breath of Fire II) sowed discord amongst the Dragon Clan by offering to grant any wish. Feuding over the goddess' favor eventually split the Clan into two feuding sides, the Light Dragons and the Dark Dragons, who engaged in a war. Myria encouraged the fighting and watched the war escalate. Just as the world was on the brink of destruction, the ""Goddess War"" ended when a heroic Light Dragon imprisoned Myria and sealed her away using six keys.[12] Each key has a unique magical property which affects the surrounding landscape; the Light Key is hidden in the port town of Auria, providing boundless prosperity for its residents. Alternatively, the Dark Key resides near the slums of Bleak, accounting for that town's perpetual darkness.
The Dark Dragons continue to hunt their longtime enemies, the Light Dragons, and have driven them into isolation. Unbeknownst to the Dark Dragons, the Light Dragon Clan sealed away its dragon powers long ago. The game's protagonist, Ryu, is living peacefully in Drogon, a village of Light Dragons survivors. Ryu was orphaned when he was young and was raised by his sister, Sara, a priestess who can summon powerful magic. One night he dreams of a dragon that warns him of impending danger; he awakens to find his village has been set ablaze. Sara uses her magic to draw the Dark Dragons away from Ryu and the other villagers, but is taken prisoner. The Dark Dragon Emperor, Zog, has announced that it is the birthright of the Dark Dragons to conquer the planet.[13] Zog intends to release Myria by assembling the six Goddess keys. However, it could be that Zog is about to make a mistake that will lead the world to its destruction instead, so Ryu leaves the village and embarks on a quest to collect the keys before Zog can.
Ryu's first destination is the town of Nanai, under which the Earth Key is sealed. He seizes the key from the Dark Dragon forces stationed there, but ends up leveling the town doing so since the Earth Key governs seismic activity. He then travels to Windia (""Winlan"" in the official translation) but discovers that the King there has been poisoned. He briefly meets Nina, the princess of Windia, and then has to rescue her from the tower of Karma after her mission to obtain the remedy for her father goes awry due to the use of a toxic weapon called Xeon Gas, which was seemingly developed by the Dark Dragons. Once Nina's father recovers, Nina elects to join Ryu on his further adventures, and the two next travel to Tantar, the home of the wolf-like Forest Clan. They eventually discover that the chieftain of the neighboring village of Tuntar is an impostor working for the Dark Dragon Empire. Ryu and Nina venture to a nearby forest to rescue the real chief, but end up walking into a trap. Fortunately, they and the real chief are rescued by Bo, a warrior of the Forest Clan who had just escaped the custody of the Dark Dragons. He also joins them on their quest and helps them locate another Goddess Key, the Space Key.
En route to the port town of Auria, Ryu, Nina and Bo find a mysterious shrine. It is here that Ryu is forced to undergo a great trial: once he completes it, his dragon powers awaken. At Auria, the trio are mistaken for thieves and arrested, but Karn, a thief they meet inside their cell, frees them. They meet Karn again inside a tomb in the desert, and when they recover a tome containing thieving secrets, he joins the team. Back at Auria, the party discovers that the Dark Dragons have blackmailed the town's richest resident into surrendering the Light Key. They manage to foil this plot, however, by claiming the Dark Key and the Mirror from a tower near the thieves' town of Bleak and using the Mirror to allow the rich man's wife to communicate with him from beyond the grave. However, the Dark Dragons then resort to more aggressive tactics and sink the ship the party planned to board. The captain of the ship and the gold digging merchant Gobi approach the group with a plan to obtain a new ship. Their new ship is sunk as well, though, stranding them on a desert island. In order for the party to continue their quest, Gobi ventures forth alone and succeeds in acquiring the Gills, which allow Ryu and his friends to breathe underwater, and they continue on their way with Gobi as a companion.
The party's next stop is the underwater city of Prima. Gobi leads them to one of the inns there, where an aspiring blacksmith is on his sickbed while a ghost waits to take his soul into the beyond. Upon defeating the ghost, the blacksmith delivers some alarming news: the Dark Dragons are developing a new weapon and have taken the blacksmiths of the industrial town of Gant prisoner so they can build it for them. The party promises to help the blacksmith rescue his friends and family. He introduces himself as Ox and takes the party to the castle of Nabal, where the people of Gant are imprisoned. It is here that the true nature of the Dark Dragons' new weapon is revealed â a torpedo which can be used to level Prima. Ox tags along with the group as they seek the immortal witch Bleu, who has taken up residence in a moving town in the desert. With Bleu's help, the party are able to thwart the Dark Dragons' scheme to destroy Prima with the torpedo. Ox and Bleu realize the gravity of the current situation and pledge their skills to Ryu's cause. The party's adventure continues after Karn obtains the ability to fuse his comrades together, and Gobi gains the ability to transform into a giant fish using a special item.
The group continues to an underground settlement, clashing with the evil scientist and Four Devas member Cort along the way. When they arrive, they discover that one of the warriors there, a young mole person named Mogu, has been imprisoned in the Dream World by Mote, another of the Four Devas. They rescue him from the dream by obtaining a special item from Tunlan, where the Time Key is also kept (the group loses this key when Four Deva member Cerl takes it). Mogu joins the party when he is rescued, and the party next travels to the town of Spring. The Sky Key is kept in a tower near the town, but someone has used it to create a permanent winter in the area. While investigating the tower, the party discover that the culprit is Mote, and fight him within the Dream World with the aid of his conscience. After restoring the weather to normal, the party continue towards the Dark Dragon capital of Scande, but are delayed once more when they enter the town of Carmen where time is standing still. Aided by a villager named Alan, they investigate a nearby tower and confront Cerl again, who is revealed to be a childhood friend of Alan's. Consumed with a desire for vengeance against humans, she attacks and critically wounds Alan, but later swears off her vendetta when the party delivers a fruit from the village where she and Alan grew up. The final Deva Goda then appears and ambushes the party. Cerl surrenders the Time Key to Ryu's party and stays behind to cover their escape while Alan enters Cerl's castle to be with her again. While restoring the flow of time, however, something goes wrong and Nina is forced out of the party by a warping of time and space.
The party finds her moments later in Tunlan. However, she is suffering from amnesia. When the party restores her memories, the now visibly older Nina rejoins them and tells everyone that she can transform into the Great Bird. With her new ability, the party flies to Scande, where they do battle with Zog and vanquish him. Afterwards, Jade traps them in a room with Sara. Jade plays on Ryu's emotions by placing Sara under a powerful mind control spell. She takes the keys from Ryu and delivers them to Jade. The party pursues him to the tower where Myria is sealed, but are stopped midway through the tower by Sara, who attacks them. The party is forced to kill her to break Jade's hold on her; the mind control is too strong to completely dispel any other way. As she lies dying, she tells Ryu and his friends that they have done nothing wrong â Jade and Myria are to blame as they created a situation where she had to die. The party resolves to stop Jade at any cost, but are too late to prevent him from freeing Myria completely.
Ryu wakes up three days later in his hometown, which is still in ruins. He learns from his comrades and the surviving Light Dragon members that Jade has unearthed the Obelisk from beneath Scande and that he, Goda and Myria have taken up residence within. They infiltrate the Obelisk with the assistance of Mogu's clan. Goda attempts to bar their path within the Obelisk, but is defeated. The party presses on to find Jade, who is enraptured by the power of Myria and engages the party in battle, but is defeated and slain. He ominously announces that the party will soon face the fell goddess responsible for the Goddess War thousands of years ago.
The party confronts Myria in the deepest room of the Obelisk, initially in the guise of a defenseless female. However, when Ryu uses the ultimate dragon power against her, Myria becomes enraged and transforms herself into a demon. The party battles her one final time and defeat her. She vows to return and destroys the ground under the party's feet. They are rescued by Nina's clan and taken to Wyndia, where Ryu sees Sara's apparition one last time. She expresses pride in Ryu for defeating Myria when the Light Dragon Warrior of the past failed to do so. The party members go their separate ways and devote themselves to reconstruction efforts across the globe now that the war is over.
","Breath of Fire is a traditional role-playing video game, featuring two-dimensional character sprites and environments presented from a top-down perspective.[4] Players move their characters in four directions while navigating through a number of environments ranging from towns to dungeons filled with traps and monsters. In order to advance the story, the player must take part in story-based scenarios that require them to enter dangerous areas and defeat enemies while also interacting with non-player characters to become involved in the plot.[5]
During gameplay the player's main character, Ryu, will meet other characters that join his party, each with their own distinct abilities in and out of battle.[6] These include differing magic spells as well as unique Personal Actions that can be performed in certain situations that allow the player to interact with the game world, solve puzzles, or navigate environments more easily. A player's active group can consist of up to four members at a time, but may switch any of them with reserve members at any time, even in the middle of battle. The game uses an icon-based menu system that organizes the player's stock of items, equipment, and character information, with subsystem shortcuts than can be set to unused buttons on the game controller for ease of access.[5] As the game progresses, players may purchase or find items and equipment that can aid each character and make them stronger.[7]
Players advance the game by doing battle with enemy creatures. Combat in Breath of Fire takes place in hostile areas such as dungeons, with encounters occurring randomly every few steps.[8] The game uses a turn-based system while in combat, where the player inputs commands for each character at the start of each round, which are then carried out by order of their ""agility"" rating. While each controllable character's health is indicated by numerical hit points, an enemy's vitality is represented by a colored bar that decreases as they take damage, and must be reduced to nothing in order to be defeated.[9] Stronger boss characters have the ability to continue battle even after their health bar is depleted, with their true remaining health being obscured for the rest of the battle. Characters can cast spells to harm enemies or aid their allies, which require AP (Ability Points) in order to be cast.

Breath of Fire II|Breath of Fire II: Shimei no KoJP,No,"2001JP2002NA , PAL",Capcom,"CapcomJP, NAUbisoftPAL","NA, PAL, JP","The characters of Breath of Fire II were designed by Capcom artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who also provided artwork for the cast of the previous game. Breath of Fire II features nine playable characters who join the player's party at set points throughout the story, each with their own selection of attacks, magic spells, and personal actions which can be used to pass certain obstacles and solve puzzles.[6]
The main protagonist is a 16-year-old boy named Ryu Bateson, who shares his name with the main character from the original Breath of Fire, who mysteriously finds himself alone in the world one day after his father and sister disappear and all townspeople in his village forget who he is. As a member of the elusive Dragon Clan, Ryu possess the ability to transform into powerful draconic beings with destructive abilities, and makes his way as a ""Ranger"", a sword-for-hire.[6] He is joined by his friend and fellow Ranger, Bow (""Boche Doggy"" in the Japanese version),[10] a thief and member of the Grassrunner clan of dog-people who uses a crossbow and healing spells. Throughout the game, players recruit additional characters at different points in the story, including Katt (""Rinpu Chuan"" in the Japanese version),[10] a member of the Woren clan of cat-people who fights at a coliseum; Rand Marks, muscular pangolin-person who fights with his bare hands; Nina Windia, descendant of the original Nina from Breath of Fire and princess of a clan of winged humans who was exiled due to her black wings, a bad omen in her country; Sten Legacy, a former soldier from a kingdom of monkey-people who makes his way as a trickster and performer; Ekkal Hoppa de Pe Jean, or simply Jean (""Tapeta"" in the Japanese version),[10] a love-struck prince of a race of frog-people who struggles to regain his kingdom after his throne is usurped; and Spar (""Aspara Gus"" in the Japanese version),[10] an emotionless plant man who can commune with nature and is held captive by a traveling sideshow.[6] An optional character in the form of the immortal sorceress Bleu (""Deis"" in the Japanese version) from the original Breath of Fire may also be recruited.[11]
Breath of Fire II is set in a fantasy world 500 years after the events of the original game.[3] The story opens on Ryu, age 6, who lives in the village of Gate with his sister Yua and father Ganer, a priest for the Church of St. Eva. Years earlier, Ryu's mother disappeared when demons erupted from a hole in a mountain on the outskirts of town, which was eventually blocked by a large dragon who sacrificed its life to stop the invasion. One day after visiting the lifeless dragon near the mountainside, Ryu returns to find his family missing and no one in the village remembers who he is. Believing him to be an orphan, the townsfolk send him to live at the church with Father Hulk, who has apparently been acting pastor for years. It is there that he meets Bow, a fellow orphan who convinces Ryu to run away with him to a big city and live as thieves. Upon leaving the village, the two seek shelter in a cave during a storm, where they encounter an enormous demon named Barubary who claims that Ryu is the ""Destined Child"", knocks the two unconscious, and disappears.[12]
Ten years later, Ryu and Bow live together in HomeTown as members of a Rangers guild, who are tasked with finding the lost pet of Mina, princess of the Kingdom of Windia. The two reluctantly complete the task and upon their return, Bow is charged with stealing from a local rich man named Trout. Bow claims he was framed by a mysterious ""winged thief"". Both escape the town the following night, and Bow remains in hiding while Ryu leaves to find the real thief and clear his friend's name. Making his way to Coursair, a town with a large coliseum, to gather information, he becomes a challenger in the arena against Katt, the coliseum's most popular fighter. In defeating her, Ryu gains her trust when he reveals the organizer is possessed by a demon. They defeat the demon with the help of Rand, an employee at the Coliseum. After visiting Bow once again, Rand stays behind to help construct the hideout while Ryu and Katt travel back to the scene of the crime. There, they meet Nina, a young girl studying magic. When her younger sister is kidnapped by a gang in an effort to blackmail Nina, Ryu and Katt resolve to help them and ultimately defeat the gang's leader, who is also a demon in disguise. When the trio make their way to Windia, they quickly find themselves expelled from the castle due to Nina's black wings. They meet a trickster named Sten, who accompanies them after Ryu spares him for trying to con them. Upon arrival at the port town of Capitan, Ryu meets a Shaman, who taps into his latent ability to transform into a dragon, revealing him to be a part of the Dragon Clan thought missing for hundreds of years. They also encounter Ray, a wandering priest of St. Eva whom the party assists in rescuing a number of villagers from Capitan's dry well. Afterwards, Bow's hideaway is rebuilt and Rand rejoins the party.
Upon traveling to a new continent, the group meets Jean, a frog-prince whose castle of SimaFort has been usurped by an impostor. After Jean fails to best the impostor in a cooking challenge, Ryu and his friends defeat him in his true demonic form. The group finally catches the real thief, a bat-winged girl named Patty, who they turn over to Trout. Bow rejoins the group, but is worried about Patty despite her actions. He and Ryu break into Trout's house at night and find Patty in a secret dungeon, along with several other residents. Trout is also possessed by a demon and engages Ryu and Bow in combat, but is defeated. Suspecting the demon outbreak to be part of a larger problem, the party searches the world for the Grassman Spar, who is said to be able to communicate with plants. Upon rescuing Spar from the clutches of a traveling sideshow, the group consults with the Great Wise Tree and discover that he is losing his memory. He requests that the party acquire the Therapy Pillow from the city of Tunlanâa quest that first necessitates retrieving the Famous Flute from Sten's hometown of Highfortâso that they can enter his mind to restore it. In doing so, they discover the underlying reason why the people of Gate had forgotten Ryu: A demon named Aruhameru had used dark magic to erase their memories of him and his family, and he is now doing the same to the Great Wise Tree's memories. Once the group vanquishes Aruhameru, they learn that the demon outbreak is linked to Gate, Ryu's hometown where all the trouble started, and that the Church of St. Eva may not be all that it seems. Investigating further, the team joins with a group of rebels who plan to storm the religion's main church located on an island inaccessible by sea, where Rand's mother Daisy has been taken captive. Hoping to use the power of flight, Nina returns to Windia and inquires about the ""mark of the wing"", an old relic that will allow her to transform into the Great Bird. After consorting with the spirit of the original Nina from Breath of Fire, Nina plans to undergo a ceremony that will transform her into a bird permanently,[13] but is stopped by her sister Mina who takes her place, sacrificing her humanity.
Traveling on Mina, the group makes their way to the church and they sneak inside. It is revealed that the religion is a front for a demon lord who uses the prayers of the people to empower itself. While pursuing the high priest, Ray blocks their path and attacks the party in dragon form, revealing himself as a member of the Dragon Clan. The battle awakens a powerful new dragon form in Ryu, which he uses to vanquish Ray. The party then rescues Daisy, who sacrifices herself in a trap so that Rand can continue fighting. In the bowels of the church, they find Ryu's father Ganer attached to a large energy-draining machine, having been kidnapped by Aruhameru ten years ago. Ryu and his friends rescue him and escape the church as it self-destructs, making their way back to Gate to stop the demons' plot once and for all. In Gate, they meet Father Hulk, the pastor who took over the Gate church years ago after Ganer was imprisoned. In order for Father Hulk to open the seal in the mountain, he needs a member of the Dragon Clan. Ryu and friends are tricked into bringing him the thief Patty, whose heritage reveals her to be Yua, Ryu's sister. Father Hulk then reveals himself as the demon Habaruku, founder of the Church of St. Eva, and Ryu and company slay him. The dragon at the mountain dissipates and transforms into the spirit of a woman, Ryu's mother Valerie, a member of the Dragon Clan who traveled from their hiding place in the mountain years ago and married Ryu's father, later sacrificing herself to save the town. Ryu and his team enter the cave, traveling deep underground to the demon stronghold, where they meet the last remaining members of the Dragon Clan. After gaining the ultimate dragon power of Anfini, Ryu battles Barubary, the demon from his past. After vanquishing him, the party confronts his master, Deathevn, leader of the St. Eva religion revealed to be a remnant of Myria, the mad goddess from the previous game.[14] After unleashing his full strength, Ryu defeats Deathevn and returns home with two possible endings based on whether the player rescued his father from the St. Eva Churchâeither sacrificing himself like his mother by transforming into a dragon to prevent further demon encroachment, or by having Ganer pilot a floating landmass on top of the mountain and seal it off for good.[15]
","Breath of Fire II is a traditional role-playing video game featuring two-dimensional character sprites and environments.[4] Players view the game from a top-down perspective and move their characters in four directions across various environments including towns and dungeons while interacting with non-player characters and battling enemies to advance the story. 
The game features a redesigned, text-based game menu as opposed to the icon-based design of the original Breath of Fire, as well as a new ""Monster Meter"" that indicates the probability of encountering enemy monsters in a given area.[5] Players are required to venture into dangerous areas throughout the game world as dictated by the story, and randomly encounter enemies every few steps which must be defeated to advance. As the game progresses, new characters, each with their own specific abilities, join the player's party. Like the previous game, only four characters may be in a party at a given time, but now may not be freely switched outside of certain areas. Each character has a unique Personal Action that may be performed outside of combat that allows the player to access certain areas, destroy objects, avoid traps, or move about the game more easily.[6] Breath of Fire II includes a new town-building feature that allows the player to populate their own village with special characters found throughout the game.[7] Each character has their own distinct job, and may be invited to live in houses that the player adds by donating currency to one of three carpenters, each with their own building style. Six special inhabitants known as Shamans may also join the town, each with their own elemental alignment, and up to two at a time may be fused with party members to grant them new forms and abilities. While joined with a shaman, characters become stronger and may gain access to additional abilities while in battle.[7]
Combat in Breath of Fire II is presented using a turn-based approach, where the player inputs commands for each character at the start of each round with the actions taking place by order of each character's and enemy's ""agility"" rating.[8] A new Formation feature allows the player to organize their party into different positions, allowing certain members an increase in speed, defense, or attack power. Players win battles by defeating every enemy present, dealing damage by using normal attacks along with magic spells and items. When all enemies are defeated, they yield experience points that go toward leveling up characters, making them stronger and giving them access to new spells.[8] Each character's health is represented by numerical hit points that indicate their remaining vitality, and are knocked out if the value reaches zero, with the battle ending if each member of a player's party is knocked out. Progress is recorded using the game cartridge's internal battery back-up memory, which can be accessed at dragon statues throughout gameplay.[9]

Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars,No,2002,Revolution Software,BAM! Entertainment,"NA, PAL","While on holiday in Paris, American tourist George Stobbart witnesses an assassin dressed as a clown steal an old man's briefcase from inside a cafÃ© and kill him with a bomb. George then meets and teams up with photo-journalist Nicole Collard; she was supposed to meet the old man, Plantard, and is investigating a string of assassination involving the same person in different costumes. George tracks the assassin to a hotel within the city, thanks to clues they left behind near the cafÃ©, and recovers an ancient manuscript from the hotel safe that the assassin, known as Khan, had taken from the old man. George smuggles the document around a pair of thugs that are after it as well. George and Nicole discover it to be related to the Knights Templar and housing clues relating to places across Europe and the Middle East.
Discovering a tripod mentioned in the manuscript being housed in a local museum, George visits the site from where it came from at Lochmarne, Ireland. He learns that the archaeologist who found it, Peagram, had disappeared, leaving a package in the care of his assistant. The assistant is abducted by Khan outside a local pub, dropping the package. George tracks it down; it contains a gem mentioned in the manuscript. At the excavation site, he locates a mural pointing him to the MontfauÃ§on in Paris. In Paris, George investigates a hospitalised man named Marquet who wanted the gem, and learns the tripod is to be stolen, moments before Marquet is murdered. George and Nicole thwart the theft, and hold on to the tripod.
George finds a hidden chamber beneath MontfauÃ§on, within the city's sewers. He spies on a group there claiming to be successors of the Templars and plotting their rise, Marquet's killer among them; Marquet (who they say ""was a liability""), Peagram and Plantard are revealed as Neo-Templars as well. After they leave, George investigates the chamber, discovers through the gem and tripod another clue pointing to the village of Marib in Syria, and travels there. George discovers a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head detailed in the manuscript. He uncovers in a hidden cave a glass lens that the Neo-Templars sought, an idol of the being called Baphomet, and a stone map of Britain. Khan, who had been seeking George, arrives and corners him, but George outwits the assassin and escapes.
Back at Nicole's, George learns from her that a friend, AndrÃ© Lobineau, uncovered his next destination: a villa in Spain owned by the De Vasconcellos family. With permission from its sole surviving member, George examines the grounds and the family mausoleum and uncovers the family's chalice, hidden centuries ago. Returning to Paris, George tracks down the tomb of a De Vasconcellos ancestor at the MontfauÃ§on, and investigates an excavation site that had uncovered another idol of Baphomet, using the chalice to find another clue depicting a church with a square tower. George investigates the grounds in Spain further and finds a hidden well based on biblical references taken from the tomb. Within, he discovers a mural depicting a river running across a chessboard.
George and Nicole compile their clues with the help of AndrÃ©, and learn that the Neo-Templars are travelling to a site under the ruins of a church in Bannockburn, Scotland. The pair takes the night train to get there, only for the Neo-Templars to abduct Nicole. An old lady from their carriage is revealed as a disguised Khan, who helps George to overcome the kidnappers and rescue Nicole. Before dying from his wounds, Khan, implicated to belong to the Hashshashin sect opposing the Templars, explains that he and George were on the same side. The pair arrives to the church, where they discover the Neo-Templars seek to acquire the power of Baphomet and reforge his sword, the titular Broken Sword. To stop them, George and Nicole destroy the site with explosives acquired from Khan, burying the Neo-Templars and destroying the ruins above. When the explosion is finished, they kiss.
","Broken Sword is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface to interact with the environment and to guide protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world.[2] To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees presented through ""conversation icons"" to learn about the game's puzzles and plot.[3] Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. The player navigates with a map, to which new locations are added as the story unfolds. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point.[2]

Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King|Buffy - Im Bann der Daemonen: Koenig Darkhuls ZornGER|Buffy contre les Vampires: La Colere de DarkhulFRE,,2003,Natsume,THQ,"NA, PAL","Adapted from the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Wrath of the Darkhul King follows Buffy Summers, a Slayer destined to fight vampires, demons, and other supernatural entities. Taking place in the show's fourth season, the game features the Darkhul KingÂ â a demonic warlord who ruled the Earth for over 500 years before a witch trapped him in his own dimensionÂ â as the main antagonist. Buffy starts an extra credit assignment on the museum's Amelia Earhart exhibit, but she is interrupted when a demon steals a talisman. Her alliesÂ â Rupert Giles, Willow Rosenberg, and Xander HarrisÂ â do research while Buffy conducts patrols. Xander's girlfriend and former vengeance demon Anya Jenkins provides insight on the demons, informing Buffy that they typically work for a master.
Buffy confronts the leader of a vampire nest, Adam, and demons known as the Gentlemen and their minions. During her patrols, she finds demons excavating for the Scepter of Thelios and later conducting a ritual. Giles informs her that they are attempting to free the Darkhul King, and he advises her to locate the demon's prison, the Temple of Shadows. When the Darkhul King is freed, Buffy recovers the Glove of Myhnegon to defeat him. She beats the Darkhul King, who swears revenge against her. After beating him, Buffy realizes that her mission distracted her from completing her extra credit assignment.
","Wrath of the Darkhul King is a side-scrolling platform game with beat 'em up elements.[1][2] The game is divided into 16 linear levels in environments that include a cemetery, an abandoned hospital, and a college campus.[2][3] The levels include obstacles, such as pendulums, spikes, falling rocks, and unstable platforms.[1][2] The player, as Buffy Summers, completes levels by locating the correct switch to open a gate or turn off hazards, such as a steam pipe.[2] Buffy can progress through levels by swimming and by using ladders, ropes, and metal bars.[1][2][4] In some areas, she can rescue people who are all portrayed as men in red shirts.[5] When the game's difficulty levels are adjusted to a more challenging setting, the entrances and puzzle solutions are changed.[1]
Buffy encounters bosses including the supersoldier Adam and the demonic Gentlemen;[3] there are five enemy types: a male and a female vampire, the Gentlemen's minions, and two species of demons.[2] Vampires are primarily killed with stakes, which can be found throughout each level.[2][6] Buffy can also eliminate them by destroying rooftops to expose the vampires to sunlight or by kicking them off ledges.[2][7] Buffy's primary moves are punches, blocks, a high kick, and a crouching kick;[2][3] she can also interact with objects in the environment to hurt bosses.[8]
Throughout the levels, Buffy can find and use 16 types of weapons[1] including an axe, a crossbow, a dagger, a flamethrower, holy water, a laser rifle, a torch,[1][3][6] and the Glove of Myhnegon.[9] Each weapon can only be used a limited number of times.[1][6] Ranged weapons stun enemies, but only melee weapons and physical attacks can defeat them.[10] Each weapon becomes more powerful with upgrades, such as combining a torch and a dagger to make a flaming dagger. Buffy accesses weapons via an inventory screen.[1][6]
Although Buffy is the only playable character, other characters from Buffy the Vampire Slayer appear in cutscenes between levels.[6][7] These scenes are digitized stills from the series, and dialogue is conveyed through subtitles.[3] Buffy's boyfriend Riley Finn appears in certain areas to provide weapons and health in the form of presents.[11]

Each sub-level has a specific animal to hunt, though some animals are hunted multiple times on separate occasions, and occasionally the player will encounter other objectives within a level. Money is earned along the way, which can be spent on more advanced firearms and other equipment. A few opportunities will arise for the player to win a gun by completing certain tasks. A total of 26 different animal species can be hunted in the game, including white-tailed deer, timberwolves, and peccary.
Other play modes include Quick Hunt, starting with one sub-level per region; other levels become available as they are completed in the Career mode, and Tournaments, including skeet shooting.
For full information on the console version of the 2005 Adventures, see Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2006 Trophy Season. The PC version of the 2006 Season is identical to the console version of the 2005 Adventures.
The PC version of the game operates much differently, and allows the player to select locations and unlock them upon their completion. It operates exactly like its predecessor, Cabela's Big Game Hunter: 2004 Season. 
The game includes 10 maps located across North America. The maps are much more diverse and unique than those of the 2004 Season. Unlike the previous game, each map can only be played in two seasons. The seasons in question depend on the map. Each season features a different game from the other one, requiring the player to play all but one of the maps twice in order to complete the game. The game also imposes firearm restrictions based on each season in each map. The most prevalent restrictions are those that allow either rifles and shotguns or those that allow any weapon of choice. Other locations include bow-only seasons, and one includes a shotgun-only season. The player may only carry two weapons on each hunt. There are a total of 26 game mammals to hunt.
The player will always have to purchase tags before a hunt. Only one instance of each tag may be purchased per hunt. Game that must be hunted in instances of two or four can only be purchased in those quantities. The player must also have no more than two firearms coinciding with restriction in the area and season and clothing to enter the hunting area. The player will always load into a location with a brief visual, bearing the location name, longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, a spinning compass, and a photo of the location in the selected season. The player will have four spawn points to choose from at the menu, however the exact location cannot be chosen. The spawn points are set to a position on the map. The player will always spawn next to their vehicle (with the exception of Yukon Territory), and the player will always start a hunt at the beginning of hunting hours with clear skies. The player cannot choose the time of day or weather to begin the hunt at.
Game will always spawn throughout the map, however in differing quantities every hunt. There will always be at least one of each animal in the selected season. No less than the minimum variety of animals will spawn in a level upon loading. No more than twelve will spawn in any level. Game that requires multiple trophies per level will not have an effect on the spawn rate. For example, a player will need to bag four coyotes in one level. It is possible for only one coyote to spawn per level, requiring the player to find the next target when it respawns. Some animals may spawn within close proximity of the player; if it is a hostile animal, the player has a small chance of being attacked upon spawn.
The player will receive money for each trophy bagged, depending on distance, weapon used, and point(s) of impact. The player will also receive a clean shot bonus if the trophy is bagged in one shot. The player uses money to buy tags for each location ($200 each), as well as more firearms and bows, and more equipment as needed.
When the player wades into water deeper than waist-level, they will automatically swim and the same controls for walking apply. The player may not equip a weapon or use any items while in the water. If the player drives their vehicle into the water, they will not be able to recover the vehicle without restarting the hunt.
Any objects that the player uses - besides their weapons - will not actually be shown, even in third person. Calls, lures, food, water, medical bags, and scent cover will only play a fixed sound and give the desired effect when used. Decoys, tripod stands, tree stands, ground blinds, and various lures and baits will be shown in front of the player when used, but there is no animation for these objects.
The player only takes damage from being attacked by animals, drowning, crashing their vehicle, or overextending themselves physically when they have no energy. The player will not take fall damage from any height, walking into cacti or other natural entities, and falling into water.

Candy Land / Chutes and Ladders / Original Memory Game,,20052006,Black Lantern Studios,Destination Software,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The race is woven around a storyline about finding King Kandy, the lost king of Candy Land. The board consists of a winding, linear track made of 134 spaces, most red, green, blue, yellow, orange or purple. The remaining pink spaces are named locations such as Candy Cane Forest and Gumdrop Mountain, or characters such as Queen Frostine and Gramma Nutt.
Players take turns removing the top card from a stack, most of which show one of six colors, and then moving their marker ahead to the next space of that color. Some cards have two marks of a color, in which case the player moves the marker ahead to the second-next space of that color. The deck has one card for each named location, and drawing such a card moves a player directly to that board location. This move can be either forward or backward in the classic game; backward moves can be ignored for younger players in the 2004 version of the game.
Prior to the 2006 edition, the board had three colored spaces marked with a dot.  Two of these spaces were designated as ""cherry pitfalls"" and the other was situated in Molasses Swamp.  A player who lands on such a space is stuck (all cards are ignored until a card is drawn of the same color as the square). In the 2006 version, dot spaces were replaced with licorice spaces that prompt the player landing on it to simply lose the next turn.
The game is won by landing on or passing the final square and thus reaching the goal of the Candy Castle. The official rules specify that any card that would cause the player to advance past the last square wins the game, but many play so that one must land exactly on the last square to win. The 2004 version changed the last space from a violet square to a rainbow space, meaning it applies to any color drawn by a player, thus resolving any dispute about exactly who wins the game.
As of 2013[update], Candy Land is being sold by Hasbro with a spinner instead of cards.  The spinner includes all outcomes that were previously on the cards.

Captain Tsubasa: Eikou no Kiseki (Captain Tsubasa: Road to Glory),,2002,,Konami,JP,"Tsubasa Oozora is an 11-year-old elementary school student who is deeply in love with football and dreams of one day winning the FIFA World Cup for Japan. He lives together with his mother in Japan, while his father is a seafaring captain who travels around the world. Tsubasa is known as the Soccer no Moshigo which translates as ""heaven-sent child of football"". When he was only barely a year old, he was almost run over by a rushing bus while playing with a ball. However, Tsubasa held the ball in front of him which served as a cushion for most of the impact. The force of the bump blew him away, but he was able to right himself with the ball. Hence, Tsubasa's motto of ""The ball is my friend"". Ever since he was little, he always went out with a ball. His mother concludes that he was indeed born to only play football. At a very young age, Tsubasa already had amazing speed, stamina, dribbling skills and shotpower â he astounded anyone who saw him play.
At the beginning of the story, Tsubasa and his mom both move to the city of Nankatsu, a fictional town in Shizuoka Prefecture well known for their talented elementary school football teams and where Tsubasa meets Ryo Ishizaki, a football-loving young student who often sneaks out from his mother's public bath houses and chores to play football. He meets Sanae Nakazawa (also known as Anego) an enthusiastic girl who also loves football and helps cheer the Nankatsu high school team on and Genzo Wakabayashi, a highly talented young goalkeeper whom he soon challenges to a game in Nankatsu's annual sports festival. He also meets Roberto Hongo, one of the best Brazilian footballers in the world who is a friend of Tsubasa's father and who starts living with Tsubasa and his mother in order to train Tsubasa. Roberto becomes a mentor to Tsubasa and helps him to harness his football skills, convincing him to join Nankatsu Elementary School and its fledgling elementary school football team, which Roberto later coaches as he passes his techniques onto Tsubasa.
Tsubasa meets Taro Misaki, who has travelled around Japan due to his father's job and soon joins Nankatsu. The two become the best of friends on the pitch and real life, forming a partnership soon to be renowned as the ""Golden Duo"" or ""dynamic duo"" of Nankatsu. Soon Tsubasa and his Nankatsu team start taking on the best of elementary school football, meeting such talented players as Kojiro Hyuga, Ken Wakashimazu, Jun Misugi, Hikaru Matsuyama and many others. Tsubasa's Nankatsu squad wins numerous youth national championships and he wins the U-17 World Championships for Japan, before leaving the country to play in Brazil.
Tsubasa leaves Japan for Brazil and starts playing, with his mentor Roberto as the manager, for SÃ£o Paulo[5] (F.C. Brancos in the anime),[6] in Brazil's premier professional league, Campeonato Brasileiro SÃ©rie A, winning the final against Flamengo (F.C. Domingos in the anime) 4â3. While in Brazil, Tsubasa gets to meet several talented Brazilian players, such as his teammate and roommate Pepe, who comes from a humble background, as well Flamengo star striker Carlos Santana, a prodigious yet emotionless talent.
Enthusiastic football-loving youngster Shingo Aoi, whom Tsubasa once played against while in the high school national championships, leaves Japan to play football in Italy, where he hopes to play for a major Italian professional team.

While Tsubasa moves from SÃ£o Paulo (Brancos in the anime) to Barcelona[7] (Catalunya in the anime), Kojiro Hyuga is bought by Juventus F.C. (F.C. Piemonte in the anime). Tsubasa plays very well in training, displaying all his skills, but the Dutch coach Van Saal (Edward in the anime, inspired by Louis van Gaal, who coached Barcelona at the time) demotes him to FC Barcelona B,[7] the reserve team that plays in the second division, because Tsubasa and Rivaul (inspired by Rivaldo) cannot play together whilst Rivaul holds a key position for playmaking.[6]
Meanwhile, Kojiro Hyuga plays for his first game for Juventus (Piemonte in the anime) against Parma in the Italian Serie A, but does not score because his physical imbalance is exposed by Parma defender Thoram (inspired by Lilian Thuram).

In Germany, Genzo Wakabayashi[2] and his Bundesliga team, Hamburger SV (Grunwald in the anime version), play against FC Bayern Munich (Routburg in the anime version), led by Karl Heinz Schneider. Wakabayashi makes many great saves, impressing players and coaches from both teams, but in an attempt to win at the final moment despite the coach's decision to aim for a draw, Wakabayashi left the goal area to take a free kick shot that was stopped at the last second, which gave Bayern a chance to counterattack on an undefended goal, allowing them to win 2â1.
In Spain, the Liga begins and the match between Barcelona (led by Rivaul) and Valencia CF (San Jose in the anime) (who have just bought Tsubasa's old rival Carlos Santana) ends 2â2. Tsubasa watches the match from the tribune (in the anime version, Tsubasa plays as a substitute in the match and scores a goal).
In the second stage of the Japanese J.League, JÃºbilo Iwata, led by Misaki, Gon Nakayama (inspired by real player Masashi Nakayama), Ishizaki and Urabe, defeat the Urawa Red Diamonds led by Hayato Igawa and Sawada, 2â1.

Tsubasa ends the match with three goals and three assists and Barcelona wins 6â5.

Also in Spain, Barcelona plays a league match against Real Betis and Tsubasa scores two goals and makes an assist for Rikaar. In Japan, Wakabayashi joins the national team.
The match between Japan and Nigeria begins and Nigeria plays very well, as it has two champions Ochado (who plays in Paris SG, based on Jay-Jay Okocha) and Bobang (who plays with Shingo Aoi in Albese).

Cardcaptor Sakura: Sakura Card de Mini-Game,,2003,Affect,TDK Core,JP,"Cardcaptor Sakura takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near Tokyo. Ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus (nicknamed Kero), emerges from the book and explains that only a person with magical powers could open the seal of the book, clarifying that Sakura can do magic. Kero chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with both battle costumes and moral support. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.
Syaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and a descendant of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture the cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her in capturing the cards. Once Sakura captures all of the cards, she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend who Sakura has a crush on. Aided by her school teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.
Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a transfer student from England and later confirmed as the reincarnation of Clow Reed, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable to use the Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.
The plot of the anime series is extended, featuring 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance.[3] Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown to have in the manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing of the cards is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fiancÃ©e Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a jealous and romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran at the end of the second anime film. In the OVA that bridges the stories of the original series and the Clear Card anime, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda two years later, just like in the manga.[4]

Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow|Castlevania: Akatsuki no MinuetJP,No,2003,KCEK,Konami,"NA, PAL, JP","Aria of Sorrow takes place in the fictional universe of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse.[12][13] Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers.[12] This prophecy acts as the driving force behind the plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present.[10] The game takes place in Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game.[3]
The protagonist and primary playable character of Aria of Sorrow is Soma Cruz, a transfer student studying in Japan who possesses the ""power of dominance"", which allows him to absorb the souls of monsters and use their abilities.[14][15] He is initially accompanied by his childhood friend, Mina Hakuba, the daughter of the priest of the Hakuba shrine.[16] Over the course of the game, Soma meets additional characters that aid him in his quest: Genya Arikado, an enigmatic government agent and disguise for Alucard, the son of Dracula;[17][18] Yoko Belnades, a witch and member of the Belnades clan;[14] J, an amnesiac man drawn to Dracula's castle;[19] and Hammer, a soldier of the United States Army ordered to investigate the events occurring at Dracula's castle, although he abandons this mission and sets up a shop to sell Soma equipment (potions, weapons and the like). Graham Jones, a missionary who believes he is Dracula's reincarnation, serves as the game's antagonist.[20]
The characters were designed by Ayami Kojima, who had previously worked on the characters in Castlevania games such as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance.[21] Due to the game being set in the future, Kojima's designs are notably more contemporary, utilizing modern clothing, in contrast to the medieval attire that characters from previous games wore.[14]
The story begins in the year 2035, when Soma Cruz is visiting Japan as a transfer student and living near the Hakuba shrine. During a solar eclipse, he visits the Hakuba shrine with his childhood friend Mina Hakuba.[16] He and Mina are then drawn into the eclipse, landing in a mysterious castle, where they meet a government agent named Genya Arikado. Arikado reveals that they are in Dracula's castle.[22] After a group of monsters appear and are dispatched by Arikado, one of the monsters' souls is absorbed by Soma. Arikado explains this as the awakening of Soma's ""power of dominance"".[15] Arikado then directs Soma to enter the castle and seek ""the master's chamber"".
As Soma proceeds through the castle, he confronts several characters, each present due to a prophecy related to Dracula's powers. Graham Jones, a missionary that has come to the castle, befriends Soma. Graham explains the nature of the castle[23] and reveals that Dracula, long thought to be immortal, was destroyed for good in 1999, and that his powers will be passed down onto his reincarnation.[12] When Soma proceeds further into the castle, he meets the witch Yoko Belnades, who is present on the orders of the Roman Catholic Church. Yoko is looking for Graham, who she believes is dangerous and the inheritor of Dracula's powers.[24] She clarifies the nature of Soma's powers, revealing that they are not necessarily evil, but inherent to Soma himself.[25] Later, Soma encounters Hammer, a member of the United States Army ordered to come to the Hakuba shrine. He has forfeited his mission, however, in favor of selling goods.[26] He becomes Soma's vendor, selling numerous goods to aid Soma's mission. A mysterious man then accosts Soma, asking about the nature of Soma's dark power. When Soma continues to converse with him, the man reveals that he has amnesia, and the only thing he remembers is his name starts with ""J"".[19]
Soma meets Graham again, and questions him on Yoko's suspicions. Graham claims he will receive Dracula's powers, believing himself to be Dracula as he was born on the day Dracula was slain.[20] Graham inquires as to the nature of Soma's powers, to which Soma responds that he has ""the power to rule,"" causing Graham to panic and flee.[27] Concerned, Soma confides this incident to Yoko, who recommends that Soma join her in stopping Graham.[28] As Soma proceeds further through the castle, he comes upon a scene of Graham stabbing Yoko with a knife. Graham retreats, and Yoko warns Soma of Graham's power.[29] Arikado arrives, promises Soma he will look after Yoko, and demands that Soma pursue Graham.[30] Soma meets ""J"" again, who reveals he is Julius Belmont, the man who defeated Dracula in 1999.[13] As he leaves, he remarks that he knows something about the current situation, but does not elaborate.[31]
Soma ascends to the castle's keep and confronts Graham in the throne room. Although Soma's sole desire is to leave the castle, Graham is convinced that Soma must be killed for absorbing the souls of the castle's monsters.[32] Soma manages to defeat Graham, even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form. As Graham falls in defeat, Soma absorbs his powers, and realizes he is Dracula's reincarnation.[33] Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of chaos into the castle.[34] Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm, but Julius attacks him, believing that Soma is Dracula.[35] Julius allows Soma to defeat him, as he sensed Soma's soul fighting against Dracula's influence.[36] Before he leaves, Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula.[37] Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of chaos. Soma manages to defeat the manifestation of chaos and is sent congratulations by Yoko, Hammer, Julius, and Arikado. Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina, pleased that the conflict is over.
","Aria of Sorrow features a 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay where the player controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing video games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each ""level"" gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle.[1] Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which determine the number of times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells.[1] Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2035, the available weapons are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears; though a handgun is available.[2] These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.[2] Items and other accessories can be found by defeating enemies or by purchasing items from the game's shop.[1]
Similar to previous games in the series, Aria of Sorrow is set within Dracula's castle, which is divided into several areas that the player traverses.[3] These areas feature different components, such as different enemies, varying terrain characteristics, and a unique piece of theme music. Similar to most platform games, progression between areas is limited by the abilities the player has.[4] While the method in which the player progresses through the game is initially linear, the player's options become more diverse as the number of character abilities increases.[3]
Aria of Sorrow introduces the Tactical Soul ability system to the Castlevania series. It involves absorbing the souls of enemies in order to gain additional abilities.[5] Save for a few exceptions, all types of enemies in the game can eventually yield a unique soul that can be absorbed by the player.[6] The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between enemies.[7] Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.[3]
Souls provide a variety of effects, and are separated into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls.[8] Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant souls are identified with the colors red, blue and yellow respectively, and the player can only have one of each type equipped at any given time. Bullet souls are Soma Cruz's replacement for sub weapons in this game, and enable the player to consume a set amount of magic points to use an ability, often some form of projectile.[8] Guardian souls provide continued effects, including transforming into mythical creatures and summoning familiars.[6] Guardian souls continually drain magic points as long as they are active. Enchant souls are continuously active as long as they are equipped, and provide either an increase in statistics, or abilities such as the ability to walk on water.[9] The fourth type, Ability souls, are treated differently from the other three types. They originate from one-of-a-kind enemies in the game, and once obtained, they remain active as long as the player does not specifically disable them,[8] not consuming any magic points.[2]
Aria of Sorrow includes additional modes of play that display elements not seen in the game's primary scenario. The New Game+ option allows a player that has completed the game to replay the game with all equipment, levels and souls the player had acquired in a previous file.[10] Additionally, the player can opt to start the game in Hard Mode, offering the same gameplay at a higher difficulty level.[10]
Two other modes offer alternatives to the standard gameplay. Boss Rush mode involves the player facing against all of the game's bosses in quick succession, and is unlocked after the player completes the game once.[11] Julius Mode is an additional mode of play unlocked with the same method.[11] The player takes control of Julius Belmont, the member of the Belmont clan featured in the game.[11]

The premise of the original series is the eternal conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Circle of the Moon's protagonist, however, is Nathan Graves, whose parents died a decade ago to banish Dracula.[7] Morris Baldwin, who helped in Dracula's banishment, trained him to defeat Dracula and the monsters; Morris ultimately chose him as his successor and gave him the ""Hunter Whip"", to the displeasure of Hugh, Morris' son who trained alongside him.[7][8]
At an old castle, Camilla, a minion of Dracula, revives him, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Morris, Nathan, and Hugh. Before they are able to banish him again, Dracula destroys the floor under Nathan and Hugh, causing them to plummet down a long tunnel. Surviving the fall and wishing to find his father, Hugh leaves Nathan behind. Nathan proceeds to search the castle for his mentor.[9] Along the way, he learns that at the next full moon, Morris' soul will be used to return Dracula to full power.[10] He also periodically encounters Hugh, who becomes more hostile as the game progresses.[8][11] Eventually, Nathan encounters Camilla, who hints that she and Dracula are responsible for the changes in his personality.[12] Nathan vanquishes Camilla in her true form and meets up with Hugh once more. Upon seeing him, Hugh immediately attacks him with the goal of proving himself to his father through Nathan's defeat; Nathan, however, realizes that Dracula is controlling Hugh. Nathan defeats him, and Dracula's control over Hugh breaks. Confessing that he doubted his self-worth when Nathan was chosen as successor, Hugh tasks him with Morris' rescue.[13]
Arriving at the ceremonial room, Nathan confronts Dracula, who confirms that he had tampered with Hugh's soul to cause the changes in his personality.[14] They begin to fight and halfway through, Dracula teleports away to gain his full power. Hugh then frees his father and tasks Nathan with Dracula's banishment. Nathan continues the battle and defeats Dracula; escaping the collapsing castle, he reunites with Morris and Hugh. Nathan is declared a master vampire hunter by Morris. Hugh vows to retrain under Morris due to his failure.
","Circle of the Moon makes use of a 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay, similar to many of the previous Castlevania video games.[3] The objective of Circle of the Moon is to lead player character Nathan Graves through a monster-filled castle as he searches for his kidnapped mentor.[4] Like many of the previous Castlevania protagonists, Nathan uses a whip to attack and defeat enemies, alongside secondary weaponsâan axe, cross, holy water, dagger and stopwatchâonly one of which may be carried at any time by the player.[4] Hearts, typically found within candles, are used as ammunition for subweapons, with some using more than others.[3] Circle of the Moon follows a nonlinear style of gameplay: at the beginning of the game, Nathan can only traverse certain areas of the castle; by obtaining various abilities, such as becoming able to run, double jump, and wall kick, he gradually explores the castle.[4] He will also encounter rooms with the ability to teleport him across portions of the castle and rooms which will restore his health and allow the player to save their progress in the game.[3] The game automatically updates the castle map to reflect Nathan's progress through it.[4]
Circle of the Moon incorporates role-playing elements.[5] Nathan possesses various statistics: hit points, the amount of damage he can withstand before dying; magic points, how often he can cast a magical attack; strength, the power of his physical attack; defense, his resilience to damage inflicted by the monsters; intelligence, the recovery speed of magic points; and luck, the frequency with which items are dropped by enemies.[3] Defeated enemies drop various items and equipment, and provide experience points; after reaching a predetermined amount of experience points, Nathan will level up, and his statistics will improve.[4] The defeat of boss enemies allows the player to acquire new abilities to progress further in the game.[3]
Unique to Circle of the Moon is the Dual Set-up System (DSS), based on magic cards found throughout the game that belong to one of two categories: Action and Attribute.[5] Each of the ten Action card takes its name from one of the gods and goddesses from Roman mythology, and determines the type of magic being performed, while the ten Attribute cards take their names from creatures from Greek and Roman mythology, and add an effect to the magic.[3][5] To produce a magical effect, the player combines one card from each of the two categories, for a total of one hundred different combinations.[5] In ""The Battle Arena""âan optional area of the castle which consists of seventeen rooms filled with stronger versions of monsters found elsewhere in the castleâNathan's supply of mind points is drained, causing the DSS cards to become temporarily unusable.[6]
Castlevania: Circle of the Moon has four alternative modes of gameplay, which must be completed in order as completion of one mode unlocks the code for the next. Once the player has finished Circle of the Moon for the first time, they receive a code that can be entered as their name when starting a new game; this code will start the game in Magician Mode, in which Nathan has decreased strength and defense, but increased intelligence and begins with all twenty DSS cards.[6] Fighter Mode does not permit the use of DSS cards, but increases his strength and endurance.[6] Shooter Mode allows a higher maximum of hearts he can carry, but gives a penalty to strength, defense, and hit points. Nathan can throw homing daggers if he collects two daggers in a row in this mode.[6] Thief Mode reduces Nathan's strength and defense, but increases his luck greatly.[6]

Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance|Castlevania: Byakuya no ConsertoJP,No,2002,KCEK,Konami,"NA, PAL, JP","Harmony of Dissonance takes place in 1748, fifty years after Simon Belmont ended Dracula's curse.[15] A result of his battle against Dracula was that the villagers changed their opinion of him and the Belmont family.[13] Producer Koji Igarashi explained: ""Simon was regarded as a life-saver, and people started to look upon him as a hero; little by little, the people started to gather around them. A village, therefore, was formed around Belmonts. Juste Belmont grew up in this environment with his childhood friends Maxim Kischine and Lydie Erlanger.""[13]
The protagonist and primary player character is Juste Belmont, the grandson of Simon Belmont and descendant of Sypha Belnades,[7][16] who at the age of sixteen, gained the Vampire Killer whip.[17] Together with his amnesiac and injured best friend Maxim Kischine, he sets off to rescue his kidnapped childhood friend, Lydie Erlanger.[15] While exploring the castle, he encounters a merchant who stumbled upon the castle[18] and Death, Dracula's servant.[19]
Juste meets Maxim at a castle where Lydie is being held captive; after a brief talk, he leaves Maxim outside and begins to explore the castle.[20] Within the castle, Juste encounters Death, who confirms that the castle is Dracula's.[19] He meets up with a dazed Maxim, whose memory is slowly returning to him, and they split up to cover more ground.[21] While trekking through the castle, Juste notices that the castle sometimes has different atmospheres.[22] He continues to encounter Maxim, but is baffled by how his friend seems to change personalities periodically.[23] In one of their meetings, Maxim reveals that he went on a journey to find and destroy the remains of Dracula, something Simon Belmont had previously done, but when he collected all six, his memory went blank.[16]
Juste encounters Death again, who explains that the castle has been split in two ""layers"" to accommodate the two spirits living in Maxim's body: his original spirit and an evil one created from Dracula's remains and his suppressed jealousy of Juste.[24][25] Maxim later confirms this and admits to being Lydie's kidnapper.[25] Juste meets his friend again in the other layer of the castle where he reveals that he lost his memory to protect Lydie. He gives Juste his bracelet to help him locate her in the castle.[26] However, when Juste finds her, Death kidnaps her to use her blood as a means to unite the two castles by destroying Maxim's spirit.[27] Juste defeats Death, and proceeds to search for Maxim. Along the way, he accumulates Dracula's remains, which are scattered throughout the castle. In the center of the castle, he finds Maxim with an unconscious Lydie.[28]
There are three endings to the game. In the first, Maxim, possessed, has already bitten Lydie. With Maxim's defeat, Juste escapes the collapsing castle alone and curses his inability to save either friend.[29] In the second, Maxim struggles against the possession and urges Juste to kill him. In his final moments, he thanks Juste for killing him and reveals that he had wished to save him from his fate as a Belmont. Outside the castle, Lydie awakens, unharmed, and tells Juste not to blame himself for Maxim's death.[30] The third ending begins the same as the first, except that, during the fight, Maxim notices that Juste wore his bracelet and resists the possession. Dracula flees into a weakened form using the gathered remains and fights Juste, planning to use his blood to return himself to full power. Vanquishing him, Juste escapes the castle together with Maxim and Lydie, whose bite marks disappear by the time she regains consciousness. Outside the castle, the three resolve to return home.[31]
","Harmony of Dissonance makes use of a 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay, similar to many of the previous Castlevania video games.[5] The objective of the game is to lead the player-character, Juste Belmont, through the monster-filled castle as he searches for his kidnapped friend.[5] The castle consists of two ""layers"": Castle A and B. Structurally, each castle has mostly the same room layout, but monster types, items, and other aspects vary between the two versions. Later, the player can use special warp rooms that can teleport Juste to other castle rooms and between castles.[6] The two castles share a connection; for example, the destruction of a wall in one castle can cause a change in the other.[6] The game further divides the castle into various, named areas: the Shrine of the Apostates, for example.[6] Relics and keys found within the castle allow Juste to reach previously inaccessible areas.[7][8] Harmony of Dissonance makes use of the forward dash move, which causes Juste to move forward with a short burst of speed.[9] Unique to Harmony of Dissonance is the ability to collect furniture and collectables to furnish a bare room that Juste finds in the castle.[10]
Juste primarily attacks at close quarters using the series' traditional whip weapon, the Vampire Killer. It can be brandished to deflect projectile attacks, reminiscent of Simon Belmont's usage of the weapon in Super Castlevania IV.[11] A variety of ranged sub-weaponsâholy water, a dagger, a holy book, a cross, a gem, an axe, and a thunder gauntletâare available, one of which can be carried at any given time and combined with one of the five spell booksâFire Book, Ice Book, Bolt Book, Wind Book, and the Summoning Tome[12]âhidden throughout the castle to create a magical attack.[7] Casting a spell renders the player character invincible for a moment.[6]
Harmony of Dissonance makes use of role-playing elements.[13] Defeating minor enemies and bosses procure experience points for Juste, who levels up when statistical requirements are met.[6] Leveling up increases his statistics: hit points, the amount of damage the character receives before dying; magic points, which  affects how often he can cast a magical attack; strength, the power of the physical attack; defense, the reduction of damage taken from an enemy; intelligence, the strength of the magical attack; and luck, which determines the rate of items dropped by enemies.[6] Certain relics affect his statistics: the Fang of Vlad increases his defense points, for example.[14] Equipment in the form of weapon modifications, armor and accessories can be found scattered about the castle and contribute to his statistics.[11] Occasionally, an enemy drops an item after being killed.[6] Items can be bought with in-game money from a merchant who appears in various places throughout the castle.[6]
Additional modes can be unlocked in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, the player is required to complete the game once and can fight the bosses from the game in order with the number of bosses depending on the level of difficulty selected.[6] Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub-weapon) as weapons. Maxim has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain button combinations.[6] Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.[6]

The Cat in the Hat,,2005,Jack of All Games,NewKidCo,,"On a stormy day, Conrad (Chase Chavarria) and Sally (Andrea Bowen) are confined inside their house while their mother is gone. The Cat in the Hat (Chris Edgerly) arrives to bring them cheer, but next-door neighbor, Larry Quinn (Fred Tatasciore), steals the Crab Lock that seals the Cat's magical crate, causing magic to flood the house and unleash chaos that threatens the world.[2] The Cat makes his way through different stagesâhousehold objects or rooms which have been corrupted by the magicâwith the guidance of the family's fish (Nolan North), recaptures the magic, and chases Larry Quinn, who is after the magic in a quest to become immensely powerful. After cleaning the house of magic and besting Larry Quinn, the Crab Lock reattaches to the crate, sealing away the magic.
The plot of the Game Boy Advance version is largely the same, with the exception that Conrad removes the lock, as for unknown reasons, Larry Quinn is not present.
","The hub world in this game is Conrad and Sally's House. However, when the player starts a new game, they will only have access to the Living Room, as Conrad and Sally will prevent the Cat from going upstairs and into the Kitchen and Garage, respectively. As the player clears the levels, Conrad and Sally will allow the Cat access to those areas. [3]
There are ten levels and three boss fights (two in the PC version).[3] There is also a bonus level which can be unlocked by completing the bonus stages in each level. In each level, the Cat must make it to the end to chase out Quinn while collecting the scattered magic. To traverse these levels, the cat can jump, glide with his umbrella, zipline, slam the ground with his umbrella and collect enemies and explosive goo in bubbles for use as projectiles, among other maneuvers.
The game utilizes a health meter which is a cake consisting of four slices and a cherry on top, with each slice and the cherry representing a hit point. If the Cat collides with an enemy or obstacle, a slice or the cherry is removed from the health meter. When all slices and the cherry are gone, the Cat loses a life. If the Cat loses all of their lives, the game ends. If this happens, the player can restart the current level from the beginning or return to the title screen and restart from their last save point.
The game has a variety of collectibles. Each level contains small clusters of magic whose value varies by color; if every cluster is collected within a stage, the stage's appearance in the hub world returns to normal. Collecting all of the magic in the game will allow the player to view the game's true ending where the crate is sealed. In addition to the magic, there are slices of cake that restore the Cat's health and clapperboards that unlock clips from the movie for viewing in the menu when collected. Each stage contains 4 keys which are stolen by Thing One and Thing Two. Collecting all 4 keys unlocks the bonus door at the end of the level. The bonus door at the end of each stage leads to a short segment of gameplay where the player must outrun hazards such as rolling objects, rising liquids, and laser beams to collect some additional magic and a bonus crystal at the end. The bonus stages are inaccessible in the PC version of the game due to the hardware limitations of the computers at the time the game was released.[3] So, when the player opens the bonus doors in this version, they just simply get the magic and gems instead. When a player collects a gem in a level, it will be inserted in one of the slots on the edge of the mirror near the Grandfather Clock level in the hub world. When all the gems are collected, a bonus stage called Mystical Mirror is unlocked.
Each level in the game has checkpoints, which are either tunnels or checkpoint cameras. If the Cat passes one of these and then loses a life, he will restart from the last one he passed.[3]
In the game's boss fights, the Cat fights Quinn's machine, which is powered by the Crab Lock, and must fire bubbles full of enemies into the machine's exhaust pipe to damage it. After the Cat damages the pipe enough times, he will obtain a portion of the Crab Lock needed to seal his crate. In the Xbox and PS2 versions of the game, the Cat must hit the piece of the Crab Lock with explosive goo to obtain it. If the player revisits one of these stages after completing it, Thing One and Thing Two will pilot the machine instead of Quinn.
Notes:
In addition to platforming stages, the Game Boy Advance version contains four stages where the player scuba dives to obtain pieces of the Crab Lock. There's also a bonus stage where the Cat drives his cleaning machine to catch Thing One and Thing Two. Collectibles include icons related to the theme of the stage as well as enemies that have been defeated.

Patience Phillips, a shy office worker in the Hedare corporate empire, accidentally discovers her employers' dark secret and is subsequently murdered. She is then revived by a supernatural Egyptian cat granting her cat-like abilities. Now reborn as ""Catwoman,"" she then embarks on a tale of revenge against the people who nearly murdered her.

The game is third person action plaformer where the player must use the heroine's cat-like strength and agility to travel through various environments and defeat various enemies.[3] There is also sense exploration in the game, similar to the Tomb Raider series.[4] Catwoman can climb up walls and swing from metal poles to navigate through the environment. Catwoman must also solve puzzles at certain parts of the game to advance further.  The game also features a combat system for when fighting enemies. The player is able to upgrade moves and perform simple combo strings."
Catz,,2006,MTO,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The player starts at the Adoption Center, where they may choose a Dogz or Catz to adopt of a Breedz and gender of their choice. Once the player has found a Petz, they can adopt and name their new Puppyz or Kittenz. After around three days (real time) the Petz become adults. Adult Petz can then breed and have Kittenz or Puppyz of their own in Petz 3, Petz 4, and Petz 5. Cross-breeding can create different types of petz, called 'Mixed Breeds'.
There are a number of Toyz, food and water bowls, and Treatz available. Petz can learn tricks with positive rewards such as petting and Treatz, or trained not to do something using the punishment (water) spray bottle. Petz must be looked after properly; abused or neglected Petz may run away.[7][8]
Players may share their Petz with others who have the game via an email. Each version allows the importing of Petz from all earlier versions. There is also a camera feature, permitting snapshots of Petz to be taken and saved as .bmp files.
Other animals include Pigz and Bunnyz.  Later versions of the games included a Petz Web Fun Pack, Petz Publisher and a Petz Player web browser plug-in, allowing players to publish their Petz online in playable webpages.[9] The Petz Publisher does not work anymore, due to the fact that the website has been remodeled with the newer Petz games by Ubisoft.
Users learned how to reverse-engineer the system, and began producing additional Breedz, Toyz, playscenes, clothes, and developer tools for the games, as permitted by PF Magic, Mindscape, and Ubisoft.[10]

Centipede / Breakout / Warlords,,2005,Epicenter Interactive,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The player controls a small insect-like Bug Blaster. It is moved around the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires small darts at a segmented centipede advancing from the top of the screen through a field of mushrooms. Each segment of the centipede becomes a mushroom when shot; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the screen, with the rear piece sprouting its own head. If the centipede head is destroyed, the segment behind it becomes the next head. Shooting the head is worth 100 points while the other segments are 10. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right.  When it touches a mushroom or reaches the edge of the screen, it descends one level and reverses direction. The player can destroy mushrooms (a point each) by shooting them, but each takes four shots to destroy. At higher levels, the screen can become increasingly crowded with mushrooms due to player/enemy actions, causing the centipede to descend more rapidly.
Once the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it moves back and forth within the player area and one-segment ""head"" centipedes will periodically appear from the side. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads.  When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, another one enters from the top of the screen. The initial centipede is 10 or 12 segments long, including the head; each successive centipede is one segment shorter and accompanied by one detached, faster-moving head. This pattern continues until all segments are separate heads, after which it repeats with a single full-length centipede.
The player also encounters other creatures besides the centipedes. Fleas drop vertically and disappear upon touching the bottom of the screen, occasionally leaving a trail of mushrooms in their path when only a few mushrooms are in the player movement area; they are worth 200 points and takes two shots to destroy. Spiders move across the player area in a zig-zag pattern and eat some of the mushrooms; they are worth 300, 600, or 900 points depending on how close the player shoots it. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen, turning every mushroom they touch into poison mushrooms. Scorpions are also worth the most points of all enemies with 1,000 points each. A centipede touching a poison mushroom will attack straight down toward the bottom, then return to normal behavior upon reaching it. This ""poisoned"" centipede can be both beneficial and detrimental to the player; the player can destroy them rapidly as it descends down, while at the same time, they can be very challenging to avoid, especially if already split into multiple segments.
The Bug Blaster will be destroyed when hit by any enemy, after which any poisonous or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. 5 points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. The player gains extra lives every 12,000 points (10,000 in several ported versions).

Chobits: Atashi Dake no Hito,,2002,,Marvelous Entertainment,JP,"The series centers on the life of Hideki Motosuwa, a held-back student attempting to qualify for university by studying at Seki prep school in Tokyo. Besides a girlfriend, he dreams of having a persocom (ãã½ã³ã³): an android used as a personal computer, which is expensive. On his way home one evening, he stumbles across a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl with floor-length hair lying against a pile of trash bags, and he carries her home, not noticing that a disk fell on the ground. Upon turning her on, she instantly regards Hideki with adoration. The only word the persocom seems capable of saying is ""chi"" (ã¡ã, Chii), thus he names her that. Hideki assumes that there must be something wrong with her, and so the following morning he has his neighbor Hiromu Shinbo analyze her with his mobile persocom Sumomo. After Sumomo crashes during the attempt they conclude that she must be custom-built.
Shinbo introduces Hideki to Minoru Kokubunji, a twelve-year-old prodigy who specializes in the field of custom-built persocoms. Minoru's persocoms, including Yuzuki, a fairly exceptional custom-built persocom, are not able to analyze Chi either, and thus they conclude that she may be one of the Chobits, a legendary series of persocoms rumoured to have free will and emotions. Although this is a possibility, Minoru is confident that it is only rumour. Yuzuki also adds that she does not resemble any persocom model in any available database and so she must be custom made after all.
A major part of the plot involves Hideki attempting to teach Chi words, concepts, and appropriate behaviours, in between his crammed schedule of school and work. At the same time, Chi seems to be developing feelings for Hideki, at an emotional depth she is not supposed to possess, and Hideki struggles with his feelings for her. The need to figure out more about Chi and her mysterious functions and past becomes a pull for the characters in the series.
Hideki's feelings intensify for Chi regardless of her being a persocom and despite his friends' painful experiences involving other persocoms. Chi becomes aware of her purpose through a picture book series called A City with No People which she finds in a bookstore. The books speak about many different things involving human and persocom relationships: persocoms and their convenience as friends and lovers, how there are things that they cannot do and questioning whether a relationship between a persocom and a human is really one-sided. It also speaks about the Chobits series; that they are different from other persocoms, and what they are incapable of doing unlike other persocoms. These picture books awaken Chi's other self, her sibling Freya who is aware of their past and helps Chi realize what she must do when she decides who her ""person just for me"" is. Together, Chi and Hideki explore the relationship between human beings and persocoms, as well as their friends' and their own.

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|Narnia Koku Monogatari: Lion to MajoJP",,2005,Amaze Entertainment,Buena Vista Games,"NA, PAL, JP","The fantasy land of Narnia has been under the spell of the evil White Witch, who makes it always winter but never Christmas, but when Aslan comes, it will be spring again and the Witch's reign will be over. Four children enter Narnia and, along with the legendary lion, Aslan, help defeat the White Witch and her evil minions.(This version is based on the 2005 film.)
","The objective of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is to guide the four Pevensie childrenâPeter, Susan, Edmund and Lucyâthrough the enchanted, wintery land of Narnia as they fight to end the rule of the wicked White Witch with the aid of Aslan, the talking lion and true king of Narnia.[4] Divided into fifteen levels, the game follows a linear style of gameplay, and makes use of various gameplay elements: stealth, combat, puzzle-solving, and strategy.[5] While the first two levels are set in 1940s England, the third introduces Narnia as the setting.[5] Film clips from The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe appear at the beginning and conclusion of each level.[6] The game sports both single player and co-op modes. Only two players may play at once, but there can be as many as four playable characters to switch between in each level.[4]
Along the way, the children will encounter and fight off various hostile creatures in the service of the White Witch.[5] The most physically powerful of the group, Peter, wields a sword, and Susan can use archery and attack with ranged weapons, such as snowballs.[6] Edmund carries a torch and can climb, while Lucy can tame and ride various animals.[6] The player can alternate between the characters at any time, taking advantage of each character's special moves and features.[6] Each child possesses nine special ""power moves""; Lucy can heal other characters, for example.[5] Additionally, the characters can team up with each other to produce various combo moves. For instance, Peter will swing Edmund around in a circle, while Edmund kicks anything in his path.[5]
The player can also collect coins, which may be traded in for special moves and character upgrades, such as an increase in health.[6] The player may also mark statues of petrified heroes for Aslan to restore; this directly affects the amount of reinforcements that the player will have in the final battle against the White Witch.[5] Other bonus items can be found and collected throughout the game.[6]
The gameplay of the Game Boy Advance (GBA) and Nintendo DS (DS) differs from that of the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. 
Composed of seventeen chapters,[7] the GBA version features a simpler gameplay, with only one character to play as per chapter and no ability to switch between characters during the level.[8] To navigate the frozen land, the characters may have to remove natural obstacles by clearing snowdrifts or moving rocks out of their path.[7] Combat for the characters consists of a normal attack and a stronger one.[7]  Certain skills, called nobilities, are learned by the characters as a result of aiding creatures and are accessible to all of the children once learned; one nobility allows the character to heal others, for example.[7] Found throughout the game, chests contain health restoratives, such as tea and candy, and other items.[7]
In contrast, the DS version uses a system of level-based progression.[9] The characters gain experience points as they defeat enemies, and after earning a set number, level up; each level gained allots the player one virtue point to add to a selected character's statistics and improve either his or her health points, strength, defense or ability to use skills often.[9] In addition to exploring Narnia, the characters can traverse a series of dungeons, fending off enemies and a boss.[9] The player can also go on various side quests and be rewarded with learning a specific skill.[9] The DS version allows the player to switch between characters, though not all may be available on certain levels.[8] Playable characters not currently being controlled by the player can be commanded to attack, defend or other actions, such as healing.[8]
Both versions introduce an indication of warmth, which shows how cold the player character is in the wintery land. In the GBA version, the depletion of the bar negatively affects the health of the player character, while in the DS version, the cold affects the collection of experience points and the speed of combat.[8][10] In the GBA version, building a fire or consuming tea or toast  will restore warmth to the character.[7] For the DS version, taking shelter will warm the characters.[9] The DS version also features a cycle of day and night which varies the temperature and enemies encountered.[9]

ChuChu Rocket!,Yes (SPM),2001,Sonic Team,Sega,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"ChuChu Rocket! is an action puzzle game.[1] The basic rules of the game require the player to guide mice, dubbed ""ChuChus"", into a rocket while evading them from dangerous cats, dubbed ""KapuKapus"".[2]:8â9 A brief premise is provided in the instruction manual, explaining that ChuChus are living on a space port that is invaded by KapuKapus one day. In their frantic state, the ChuChus begin running around in chaos, and so the player must guide them to their rockets to save them.[2]:2â5 Both ChuChus and KapuKapus run in a straight line, and turn right when they hit walls. A player can place up, down, left, and right arrows on the field of play, redirecting characters that step on them. Up to three arrows can be placed by a player at any time; placing a fourth arrow will make the player's oldest arrow vanish, and all arrows fade away over time. If a KapuKapu hits an arrow twice, the arrow disappears.[2]:6â9
There are several modes of play within ChuChu Rocket! including a single-player puzzle mode, a puzzle editing mode, a cooperative challenge mode, and competitive multiplayer modes. In the puzzle mode, the player is provided a limited set of arrows to place on the field to save all the ChuChus in play. The puzzle editing mode allows players to create their own puzzles like this. In the challenge mode, players are given 30 seconds to save the ChuChus in play without any arrow limitations as in puzzle mode. In the competition modes, each player has a rocket and must guide as many ChuChus as possible into their rocket in the time limit. This mode supports up to four players, either in free-for-all or team-based fashion.[2]:10â17
ChuChu Rocket! is notable for being the first Dreamcast online multiplayer game.[3] During the time Sega was operating its servers, players were able to play the competitive modes online, while also being able to upload their custom puzzles and download those made by other users. Players could use an onscreen or physical keyboard to chat with other players.[2]:16â24 Servers for the game's online functionality were brought back online by fans in 2016.[4]

Comix Zone,,2002,Virtucraft,Sega,PAL,"Sketch Turner, a ""starving artist"" and freelance rock musician living in New York City, is working on his newest comic book, Comix Zone. It is the story of the New World Empire's attempt to defend Earth from an invasion of alien renegades, with inspiration coming from Sketch's oddly vivid dreams and nightmares. One night, while Sketch is working on Comix Zone during a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt strikes a panel of his comic. In this instant, its main villain, a powerful mutant named Mortus, escapes the comic book's pages, desiring to kill Sketch so he can become flesh and blood and take over the real world. Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies attempting to kill him.
Inside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is ""the chosen one"" who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch's protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus's evil plans and find a way out of this comic world.
The game has two possible endings. At the end of the game, Alissa attempts to defuse a nuclear weapon that Mortus and the Mutants plan on using to wipe out the New World Empire and humanity, when Mortus comes back into the comic and throws her into the chamber, which starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch personally. If the player defeats Mortus and the Kreeps he summons as he takes damage quickly enough to drain the liquid and save Alissa before the nuke self-destructs, an ending occurs where Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch and Roadkill and joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States. Roadkill is given a vast amount of mozzarella cheese, and spends a lot of time exploring the city's new sewer system when not sleeping under a pile of Sketch's dirty socks. Comix Zone becomes an instant sensation, selling out on the first day, making Sketch famous as it becomes the best-selling comic book ever.[5]
Defeating Mortus after the chamber fills with liquid, Alissa dies as the nuke self-destructs. Sketch and Roadkill come out, but Sketch's comic is destroyed, leaving him devastated at having saved the New World Empire, but failed to save Alissa.[6]
","Comix Zone is an action platformer in which players control Sketch as he progresses through panels of his comic book, hoping to reach the end and escape before his own creations finish him off. Each level consists of two pages and secrets are discovered by shredding the paper and revealing items. Along with standard attacks such as punching, kicking and jump attacks, Sketch can store up to three items in his inventory to help him overcome obstacles. Along with weapons such as bombs and knives which can also be used to destroy obstacles, Sketch can pick up iced tea to restore his health, and a fist that transforms Sketch into Super Sketch, dealing a powerful attack on all on-screen enemies. His pet rat Roadkill can discover hidden items and access areas that are too dangerous for Sketch to reach.
Sketch can also tear off the backdrop into a paper plane to throw at enemies, but this costs health and can also hurt Sketch if he's not careful. In order to progress through the pages, Sketch often has to either successfully solve a puzzle, or defeat all the enemies within that panel. Arrows will then appear, allowing Sketch to jump to another panel, with some areas offering multiple routes.
Sketch's health is determined by a health bar, which is diminished when Sketch is damaged by enemies or obstacles. It will also diminish as Sketch punches through breakable objects or if he uses his paper plane move. If Sketch loses all his life, or falls down a bottomless pit, the game will end and Mortus will take his place in the real world.
However, the player can gain extra chances by clearing the first and second chapters, which allow Sketch to resume from the beginning of the page should he die. Comix Zone is designed to be used with the 6-button gamepad: buttons X, Y and Z correspond to the three inventory slots Sketch has. If used with a 3-button gamepad, button C cycles through the items, and button A activates the item. Button C on a 6-button gamepad is used for a custom action, blocking by default; on a 3-button gamepad, Sketch blocks automatically.

Cortex decides to deal with Crash himself by firing the Planetary Minimizer at him after Dingodile, N. Gin and Tiny are defeated. However, Crash tricks him into shrinking the colored Gems that stabilize the Minimizer, causing it to malfunction.[14] The unrestrained effects of the Minimizer fuse Cortex and the previous bosses together, creating a monster known as Mega-Mix, who chases Crash down the space station's hallway in an attempt to kill him.[15] Fortunately, Crash escapes back to the Earth just in time for Coco to use the Crystals that he has gathered to return the Earth back to normal again.[16] The Earth is returned to its original size, while the space station above Earth explodes and Cortex and the others escape in an escape pod.
","Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure is a platform game in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot, who must gather 20 Crystals and reverse the shrinkage of the Earth at the hands of Doctor Neo Cortex, the main antagonist of the story. Much of the game takes place in a series of hubs, from which Crash can teleport to various areas of the Earth. Initially, only the first of four hubs is available for play. Each hub features five levels and a boss level. The goal in each level is to find and obtain a hidden Crystal. After completing all five levels in a hub, the boss level must be completed, in which Crash must defeat the boss character guarding the area. By defeating the boss, a new hub will be accessible for play. When all 20 Crystals are collected and the Earth has been enlarged to its proper size, the game is won.[4]
Besides Crystals, Gems and Colored Gems can be collected for extra accomplishment. Gems are rewarded to the player if all of the crates in a level are broken open or if a secret area is completed. Colored Gems are found in special levels and lead to hidden areas.[4] ""Relics"" can be won by re-entering a level where the Crystal has already been retrieved. To obtain a Relic, the player must initiate the ""Time Trial"" mode and race through a level in the pre-designated time displayed before entering a level. To begin a Time Trial run, the player must enter a level and activate the floating stopwatch near the beginning of the level to activate the timer; if the stopwatch is not touched, the level is played regularly. The player must then race through the level as quickly as possible.[5] Scattered throughout the level are yellow crates with the numbers 1, 2 or 3 on them. When these crates are broken, the timer is frozen for the number of seconds designated by the box.[6] Sapphire, Gold and Platinum Relics can be won depending on the player's final time.[5]
At the beginning of the game, Crash has the ability to jump to navigate ledges, spin in a tornado-like fashion to break open crates and defeat enemies, deliver a body slam to break open tough objects and can either slide across the ground or crouch and crawl to get past low areas.[7] Crash can expand on these abilities by defeating boss characters, often resulting in more powerful attacks or increased jumping and running prowess.[8] Crash starts the game with six lives. Crash loses a life when he is struck by an enemy attack or suffers any other type of damage. More lives can be earned by instructing Crash to collect 100 ""Wumpa Fruits"" or break open a special crate to collect a life. Crash can be shielded from enemy attack by collecting an Aku Aku mask. Collecting three of these masks allows temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers.[9]

The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is a bandicoot who must rescue his friends from the hypnosis of the main antagonist Doctor Nefarious Tropy and his ally N. Trance. Aiding Crash is Aku Aku, an ancient wooden mask who can temporarily protect Crash from harm. Crash's friends, who have been captured and hypnotized by the main antagonists, consist of Coco Bandicoot, Crash's spirited genius sister and Crunch Bandicoot, a ""super-bandicoot"" who joined Crash's family after the events of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex.[10] The main antagonist of the story, Doctor Nefarious Tropy, is the self-proclaimed master of time who teams up with Aku Aku's evil twin brother Uka Uka. A new character in the series is N. Trance, an egg-like being from the Fifth Dimension who uses his mastery of hypnotism to command Crash's friends. Also aiding the villains is Fake Crash, an deformed alter ego duplicate of Crash.[11]
After the failure of Doctor Neo Cortex's previous scheme to shrink the Earth, Uka Uka entrusts Doctor Nefarious Tropy with the task of aiding him in universal domination.[12] Tropy peers into the future and sees himself standing amongst the Bandicoots and concludes that since the Bandicoots keep thwarting them, their only solution is to bring them to their side. With this, he recruits N. Trance, master of hypnotism.[13] Meanwhile, back on N. Sanity Island, Crash Bandicoot sleeps away while his friends Crunch and sister Coco are abducted by a strange vortex. Aku Aku alerts Crash of the situation and tells him to bring him a Power Crystal so that he can see into what's going on.[14] But when he does, Crash begins to be sucked in by the vortex. While Aku Aku tries to rescue Crash, he uses the Power Crystal's power to discover that N. Tropy is behind this. With the last of his power, he rescues Crash. N. Tropy ends up abducting Crash's alter ego clone named Fake Crash, but he doesn't seem to notice and has N. Trance successfully hypnotise the Bandicoots into doing his every whim.[15]
Meanwhile, somewhere else in hyperspace, Crash and Aku Aku plan to collect more Power Crystals so that Aku Aku can open more areas of hyperspace, free Coco and Crunch, and foil N. Tropy's plan.[16] Crash frees Crunch after a battle in the skies of Baghdad and Coco is freed after a battle inside a volcano.[17][18] After Crash defeats Fake Crash inside an Egyptian tomb, N. Tropy and N. Trance realize that they've captured the wrong Crash, but assure themselves that the Bandicoots will never find their hideout.[19] However, with a few more Power Crystals, Crash and Aku Aku enter the hideout.

Tropy's defeat and capture, Aku Aku decides they should take a picture to celebrate.[20] The Bandicoots group around N. Tropy as Fake Crash takes a picture. This turns out to be the future N. Tropy saw. Meanwhile, Uka Uka, upset over N. Tropy's defeat, promises a real adversary in the future.[21]
","N-Tranced is a platform game in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot, who must free his friends from the hypnosis of the main antagonists of the story. Much of the game takes place in a dimensional bubble that Crash and his mentor Aku Aku are trapped in.[3] The inside of the bubble is displayed as a map littered with portals to different levels. Connecting the portals are dotted lines which Crash can use to travel between portals; initially, only a few dotted lines are visible. The goal of each level is to find and obtain any Crystals and Gems hidden in the area. As more Crystals are retrieved from the levels, more dotted lines will become visible on the map, allowing for further exploration.[4] Gems allow access to special levels necessary for full completion of the game. When the antagonists of the game have been defeated and enough Crystals have been gathered to return to Earth, the game is won.[3]

Spyro and Crash's recent success leads to an argument between Cortex and Ripto so they decide to send Cortex's niece, Nina Cortex, to Fire Mountain where she kidnaps Coco and the Professor. Blink the Mole informs Crash and Spyro of the kidnapping. When the duo confronted Nina, Crash distracts Nina having her chase him so Spyro can free Coco and the Professor unnoticed. This worked as Coco and the Professor are free while Nina is trapped in a cage. The Professor is disappointed as their work to track down Cortex and Ripto is destroyed so Coco hatches an idea: If Crash and Spyro can put a tracer on Cortex and Ripto, they would track them to their headquarters so the duo splits up and go to each other's home world this way their respective nemesis won't suspect anything. Only Spyro succeeds in planting a tracer on Cortex. Crash and Spyro reach their headquarters in outer space called Tech Park. As a team, Crash and Spyro defeat Cortex and Ripto once and for all.
","Ripto's Rampage and The Cortex Conspiracy are single-player side-scrolling crossover adventure games in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot and/or Spyro the Dragon in the respective games.[3] While the games feature platforming elements that allow Crash and Spyro to navigate different areas, the main focus is on a series of minigames that make up the core of the gameplay.[1][2] The minigames involve distinctively different gameplay elements, such as destroying enemies in a Breakout-inspired challenge or racing through an area with a jet pack, tank or inner tube.[1][2] The games make use of the Game Link Cable, allowing players to compete in multiplayer versions of several of the minigames found in the games.[2] Much of these minigames only require one copy of either of the games for as many as four players in the network.[1][2] Players can earn trading cards by performing specific tasks; these cards can be traded between Game Boy Advance systems to players who do not physically own a copy of the games.[2] Additional content can be accessed if the two games are linked to each other.[2]

Crash Nitro Kart|Crash Bandicoot: Bakusou! Nitro KartJP,Yes,2003,Vicarious Visions,Vivendi Games,"NA, PAL, JP","Crash Nitro Kart features around twenty-seven characters,[2] sixteen of which are playable.[10] The sixteen characters are split into four teams of four with each team driving karts of a matching color.
""Team Bandicoot"", which pilots blue karts, is led by Crash Bandicoot, the titular protagonist of the series. His kart is an all-round performer with exceptional acceleration. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger genius sister, programmed her kart's wheels to balance their speed better, improving her kart's turning ability. Crunch Bandicoot, Crash's friend, originally created by Doctor Neo Cortex to destroy Crash, pilots a kart with amazing momentum and speed but slow acceleration.[11] Fake Crash, an imperfect duplicate of Crash, becomes accessible as a playable character if the player performs 50 consecutive speed boosts on any track in Adventure Mode as a member of Team Cortex.[12]
""Team Cortex"", which pilots red karts, is led by Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash's archenemy and main antagonist of the series. Like Crash, Cortex pilots a kart that excels in acceleration. Doctor N. Gin, Doctor Cortex's right-hand man, is a mechanical genius who pilots a kart that specializes in turning ability. Tiny Tiger, Doctor Cortex's most faithful henchman, is a hulking giant who pilots a kart with a high top speed like Crunch.[11] Doctor Nefarious Tropy, the self-proclaimed master of time, becomes accessible as a playable character if the player beats all the time records in Race Time Trial Mode.[12]
""Team Oxide"", which pilots yellow karts, is led by Crash Team Racing's main antagonist Nitrous Oxide.[11] His henchmen, Zam and Zem, become accessible as playable characters if the player wins the Purple and Green Gem in Adventure Mode respectively. ""Real Velo"", the form Emperor Velo is seen at the end of Adventure Mode, is a part of the Yellow Team and becomes accessible as a playable character if the player wins the Adventure Mode twice: once as a member of Team Bandicoot and once as a member of Team Cortex.[12]
""Team Trance"", which pilots green karts, is led by N. Trance, the egg-like master of hypnotism.[11] Dingodile and Polar, whom N. Trance has hypnotised, becomes accessible as playable characters if the player wins the Red and Blue Gem in Adventure Mode respectively. Pura, whom Trance has also hypnotised, becomes accessible as a playable character if the player performs 50 consecutive speed boosts on any track in Adventure Mode as a member of Team Bandicoot.[12]
The main antagonist of the story, Emperor Velo XXVII, is the confident, dominating, bullying and contemptuous ruler of his own galaxy; he threatens to destroy Earth if Crash and Cortex's teams refuse to compete in his Galaxy Circuit. Velo is the final boss character of the game and races alongside two advisors who lay down offensive measures to slow the player down. Preceding Velo are four boss characters who possess ""World Keys"" that are needed to race against Velo. In order, the bosses consist of the following: Krunk, a hulking creature who feels that Earth is a copy of his home planet, Terra,  and races to prove which planet is superior; Nash, a genetically engineered shark-like creature who was created to always move; Norm, a goblin-like mime who races alongside a larger and more obnoxious version of himself; and Geary, a robot as much obsessed with perfection as he is with cleaning.[13]
Aku Aku and Uka Uka serve as helpers throughout the game, giving tips and hints regarding driving skills, info on objects in the hub world, tips on how to use weapons effectively, and occasional warnings during races.
Crash, Coco and Crunch Bandicoot are relaxing while their nemesis, Doctor Neo Cortex, ponders his next course of action in regards to defeating the Bandicoots and achieving world domination.[14] Suddenly, both groups are abducted by a mysterious white light that takes them to a large coliseum somewhere in another galaxy. This galaxy is ruled by Emperor Velo XXVII, who plans on having the teams race for the entertainment of his subjects. He promises the Earthlings that winning the races will win their freedom, but threatens them with the destruction of Earth if they refuse to race.[15]
After both teams accept the challenge, Velo explains that the racers will compete on four worlds of his choosing, and promises a race against the galactic champion if the champions of those worlds are defeated.[16] When Krunk, Nash, Norm, and Geary, the champions of Terra, Barin, Fenomena, and Teknee respectively, are defeated, the Earth racers go up against the galactic champion: Emperor Velo himself.[17] The racers defeat Velo, but he refuses to send them back to Earth unless they win all of the time relics and defeat him again.[18][19] Velo loses again to the Earth racers and literally explodes in a bout of fury, revealing himself to be a robot suit controlled by a small gremlin-like version of himself.[20][21]
If Team Bandicoot win the race, Velo, having lost his influence over his subjects, dejectedly relinquishes his empire to the Bandicoots.[22] Crash considers becoming the next emperor of the galaxy, but decides otherwise and gives control back to Velo in exchange for sending the Bandicoots back to Earth.[23] If Team Cortex win the race, Velo struggles with Cortex over the possession of his scepter, only to be stopped by Tiny. Cortex uses the scepter's power in an attempt to return to Earth, but the scepter breaks and sends Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny to Terra instead. When they are confronted by the natives, Tiny repairs the scepter and is subsequently revered as a king, much to Cortex's annoyance.
","Crash Nitro Kart is a racing game in which the player controls characters from the Crash Bandicoot series, most of whom race in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, brake, hop or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons.[4] Four distinct types of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of Crash Nitro Kart. ""Item Crates"" are marked with a question mark (?) and usually come in sets of four. The player can obtain a weapon or power-up by driving through an Item Crate and breaking it apart. The player can only carry one weapon or power-up at a time. ""Multiplier Crates"" are marked with an ""X"" and are usually found in hard-to-reach spots on the tracks. These special crates contain three of a certain weapon or power-up. ""Wumpa Crates"" are unmarked and carry ""Wumpa Fruit"" that strengthens the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained. ""Activation Crates"" are marked with an exclamation point (!) and activate either a boost pad or a trap that can slow down the other racers.[5]
Boosting is an important part of Crash Nitro Kart's gameplay. When the player boosts, their kart will momentarily go slightly faster than its normal top speed. Boosts are achieved by driving over boost pads scattered across the tracks, pumping the gas at the starting line, and holding the gas button at the right time when being reset on the track. Another technique used for boosting is the ""power slide"". To execute a power slide, the player holds down one of the hop buttons while steering. While sliding, a curved ""boost gauge"" appears next to the player's kart. When the gauge goes from green to red, the player presses the opposite shoulder button to obtain a boost. The higher the boost gauge goes, the more powerful the boost will be.[6]
Crash Nitro Kart features 6 racing modes: Adventure, Race Time Trial, Lap Time Trial, Quick Race, Team Race and Cup Tournament. Some modes are free-for-all, while others can be played as a team. The ""Adventure Mode"" is a single-player game in which the player must race through all of the tracks and arenas in the game and collect as many Trophies, Relics, Boss Keys, CNK Tokens and Gems as possible.[7] The objective of the Adventure Mode is to win all the races of the five different worlds and win the freedom of the playable characters from the tyrannical Emperor Velo XXVII. The hub world of the game is Velo's Coliseum, from which the player can access any of the five other worlds through special gates. Most of these gates are initially locked; the player must complete the races of one world to gain access to the next world. When inside a world, the player may access a race by driving the selected character onto a ""Warp Pad"". By winning a race, the player will receive a Trophy. When the player receives all three Trophies in a world, the player will be able to race against that world's champion, who acts as a boss character. If the player manages to defeat the world's champion, the champion will relinquish a World Key. This allows the player to engage in the special modes of that world and enables access to the next world.[8]
The special modes of each race consist of the ""Relic Race"", the ""CNK Challenge"", the ""Crystal Arena"" and the ""Gem Cups"". In the Relic Race, the player must race through a track alone and complete three laps in the fastest time possible. To aid the player, ""Time Crates"" are spread throughout the track. When the player drives the character through a Time Crate, the clock freezes for whatever number of seconds are indicated on the Crate. If all of the Time Crates on a track are destroyed, the player's final time will be reduced by ten seconds. The player wins a Relic by beating the time indicated on the screen. The CNK Challenge is played like a normal race, except that the player must also collect the letters C, N and K scattered throughout the track. If the player manages to collect all three letters and come in first place, a ""CNK Token"" is awarded. These tokens come in four different colors. If the player collects four tokens of the same color, the player will be able to access the Gem Cup of the corresponding color. Gem Cups are racing tournaments held against computer-controlled opponents, and are accessible through a special gate at Velo's Coliseum. If one of these cups is won, a Gem is awarded. When the player collects all the Trophies, World Keys and Relics, the player will be able to race against Emperor Velo on his personal racing track. If the player manages to defeat Velo in this race, the game is won.[9]
The ""Race Time Trial"" is a single-player mode where the player attempts to set the best time on any of the tracks in the game. There are no other racers to hinder the player, but no item-bearing crates are present to aid the player. When the three-lap race is finished, the player can save a ""ghost"", a replay of that race. The next time that track is accessed in this mode, the player can load the ghost, allowing the player or others to compete with the ghost in a race. If the player finishes each of the tracks in a set time, the player will be able to compete against the ghosts of the game's boss characters. The ""Lap Time Trial"" plays like the Race Time Trial except that the player races to get the best time for a single lap around the track. When one lap is finished, the player's ""ghost"" (a replay of the lap that was just completed) will appear. Whenever a better time on the lap is accomplished, the old ghost will be replaced by the faster one. In the ""Quick Race"", the player selects a character, a track and races. The player can adjust the computer's skill level and the number of laps.[7]
In the ""Team Race"", the player joins forces with a computer-controlled partner to win a race. When the player and the partner are in close proximity of each other, the ""Team Meter"" will rise. When the Team Meter is full, the player may activate the ""Team Frenzy"", in which the player and partner have temporary access to unlimited weapons and power-ups. In the ""Cup Tournament"", the player competes against other racers on three different tracks. At the end of a track, the racer in first place gets nine points, the second place racer is awarded six points, third place gets three points and fourth place gets one point; the rest get no points. When all three tracks are completed, the racer with the most points wins. This is the only racing mode that can be played by more than one human player.[7]
In the battle modes, instead of racing on tracks, the player speeds around battle arenas while collecting weapons and attacking opponents. There are five battle modes in Crash Nitro Kart. Each mode can be played by two to four players.[8] In the ""Limit Battle"", the objective is to attack opponents with weapons and traps while avoiding attacks unleashed by the opponents. Offensive and defensive weapons can be collected by smashing special crates. A point and time limit can be set by the player before the game begins. Whoever earns enough points or has enough points when time runs out wins. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams. In ""Last Kart Driving"", the contestants compete until they run out of lives. A contestant loses a life every time they are hit by a weapon or hazard or fall into a pit. A contestant who runs out of lives will be eliminated. As the title suggests, the last kart driving wins. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams.[8]
In ""Crystal Grab"", the contestants must fight to collect all the Crystals in the arena. When a contestant is attacked, they will drop any Crystals they've gathered, allowing opponents to steal them. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams. In ""Capture the Flag"", two teams attempt to capture each other's flag and bring it back to their respective flags. Players must race to their opponents' side of the map and drive over their flag to grab it. They must then drive over their own flag's base to score a point from the flag they've captured. A flag that has been stolen can be dropped if the thief is hit with any weapon. Stolen flags that have been dropped can be returned to their respective bases. Due to the weight of the flags, any kart with a flag will be slowed down. The game ends when time runs out or when one of the teams has gotten enough points. This mode can only be played in teams. ""Steal the Bacon"" is a variation of ""Capture the Flag"" in which two teams fight over one flag that is situated in the middle of the arena. The teams must attempt to take the flag and bring it to their respective base.[8]

Crash of the Titans,,2007,Amaze Entertainment,Sierra Entertainment,"NA, PAL","The setting of Crash of the Titans features twenty levels.[12] Each level is referred to as an ""episode"", and each has a distinctive subtitle that is usually a punning reference to popular culture (such as ""The Blizzard of Claws""). Like the first Crash Bandicoot game, episodes must be played in order, although the player can replay any episode that has been completed. The game moves through five major themes taking place on Crash's homeland, the Wumpa Islands. The story starts in the jungle near Crash's residence and leads to an ancient temple. Later in the game, Crash travels through a wood-cutting and mining area and a land flowing with lava that features giant steel mosquitoes sucking minerals out of the ground. The next few episodes take place on an artillery-bombarded beach, where Crash infiltrates Doctor N. Gin's missile factory, which resembles the Statue of Liberty. The penultimate area is a gigantic tree located in the middle of the island. This tree holds up an entire house owned by Uka Uka, one of the major antagonists of the series. The final moments of the game take place in the antagonist's Liberace-style lair, and finally inside the Doominator.
Nine characters from previous Crash Bandicoot titles star in the home console version of Crash of the Titans,[16] all of whom were redesigned with a ""punk"" aesthetic that is distinct from other and Japanese video game characters.[17] The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is a bandicoot who must defeat the main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and use the Titans against each other while collecting Mojo to upgrade his fighting techniques. Aiding Crash is Aku Aku, an ancient wooden mask who acts as a shield, a skateboard, and a weapon. He can also  help Crash jack Titans. Crash's other two allies are his genius younger sister Coco Bandicoot and his muscular friend, Crunch Bandicoot, who is absent in the Nintendo DS version.
Doctor Neo Cortex is a mad scientist who captures Coco and Aku Aku and wants to use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. Uka Uka, who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after tiring of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, Nina Cortex. Aiding the Cortexes are Doctor N. Gin, who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. Dingodile, another minion of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of Crash of the Titans as a boss character.[10] Aiding the villains are a number of small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua-like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. Radical Entertainment sought to give these minor characters personalities by giving them a large number of distinctive quotations.[17]
In the beginning of the game, Crash aids Coco with a butter-recycling device.[18] When Dr. Cortex arrives, not only he captures Aku Aku and Coco, but encases Crunch in ice. Crash throws Coco's machine at Cortex's airship, severing the chain holding Aku Aku's cage, which causes the cage to fall into the nearby forest. After Crash rescues Aku Aku, they discover that Cortex and Uka Uka are stealing Mojo from a nearby temple and decide to stop them.[19] On reaching the temple, Cortex reveals his plot to use the stolen Mojo to create an army of loyal mutants, which will be used to build a robot known as the Doominator, that will crush the Wumpa Islands and take over the world.[20] After failing to defeat Crash with his Yuktopus cyborg, Cortex boasts that Crash will never find his base and flies off, leaving Crash and Aku Aku to follow him.[21]
At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex for failing to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger.[22] Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her participate in the construction of the Doominator.[23] Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger,[24] Doctor N. Gin[25] and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco.[26] When they confront Nina inside the Doominator robot, she summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash.[27] Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future.[28] The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.[29]
The DS version of the game largely follows the story of the home console versions, but with minor alterations such as Nina Cortex having a greater role and the inclusion of Dingodile.[10] Near the end of the game, Nina teams up with Crash to stop Doctor Cortex and his dancing ""CortexBot"". The Game Boy Advance version also includes Dingodile, some plot differences, such as the Arachnina (referred to by its old name, ""Spiderbot"") not being the last boss, and Cortex being reinstated after Nina's defeat in the N. Trapment Island.
","Crash of the Titans is a beat-em-up game with platforming aspects in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot, whose main objective is to rescue his sister, Coco, and save his home, the Wumpa Island, from being destroyed by the main antagonist's gigantic robot.[3] The player's first goal is to rescue the sentient mask Aku Aku, who gives the player basic instructions, shields Crash from enemy attacks, and can be used as a board to help Crash traverse slippery terrain.[3] From there, each level (known as an ""episode"") asks players to complete fights against large groups of enemies or simply progress through the episode.[3]
Crash starts the game with four lives.[3] The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his health meter, which decreases whenever Crash is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit.[4] The player can replenish Crash's health meter by collecting Wumpa Fruit.[4] Each time the health meter is fully depleted, Crash loses a life. However, the player can gain an additional life for Crash by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo[5] or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit.[6] After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by restarting the current episode.[3]
Each episode contains a portal leading to a simple mini-game arena, where the player must accomplish a task in a set time.  Generally the task involves collecting a specified quantity of Mojo, jacking a titan and using its abilities, or simply defeating a select number of enemies.[7] At the end of each episode, the player earns a rank of a bronze, silver, or gold voodoo doll;[8] the rank can be improved by defeating a set number of minions, destroying three robotic toilets or inflicting a minimum number of consecutive hits in combat.[8] All three tasks must be accomplished in an episode if a gold voodoo doll is to be obtained for that episode. Hidden voodoo dolls unlock concept art packages for each episode.[9]
The Nintendo DS version of Crash of the Titans contains similar gameplay to that of previous Crash installments. The game takes place on four islands, each with two levels and a boss. When a boss is defeated, a new island is unlocked.[10] Each island has its own ""Pachinko board"" where players can win ""on-demand items""; items that can be used to restore health, provide temporary invincibility, and set off Nitro explosions among other things. Additional content can also be won at these Pachinko boards, such as gallery art, cheats and a large quantity of Mojo.[10]
Whereas the previous games featured Crash spinning into or jumping on an enemy to attack, Crash of the Titans gives him more options for attack. Early in the game, Crash has a light-powered attack and a heavy-powered attack and can also block, dodge or break an enemy's block.[11] When he defeats an enemy or destroys an object, a magical substance known as Mojo is released.[5] When Crash collects enough Mojo, he will earn either an ability upgrade or a new move, such as the Norris Roundhouse or the Triple Dragon.[5] His classic spin attack, named ""Old Skool"", is an unlockable move, along with an aerial variant that allows Crash to float over chasms.[12]
While small minions require only a single combo attack for Crash to defeat, larger enemies, known as ""Titans"", require more effort to subdue. Each of the fifteen unique Titans in the game possess a star meter that indicates how close they are to being stunned.[12][13] The meter rises when Crash starts attacking a Titan, and depletes when he stops.[12] When it is full, the Titan is stunned and susceptible to ""jacking"", meaning Crash can mount the creature and control it.[13] While controlled by the player, the Titan possesses a similar moveset to Crash,[12] although some jacked Titans can shoot projectiles.[14] Besides greater health, the Titans controlled by Crash have a purple Titan Meter. When this meter is full, players can make the Titan unleash a special attack,[14] which fully drains the meter in the process.
A Titan's durability depends on its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.
A player using a second controller can join the game at any time in the form of a white-furred version of Crash known as ""Carbon Crash"".[12][15] The second player appears in the first player's backpack, and can usually enter or exit the pack. However, the second player has to stay in the backpack if the first player is in mid-air or climbing a wall. This method of play is useful for overpowering enemies and collecting Mojo faster. There are two modes of co-op play; in ""Leapfrog Mode"", the players swap control each time the front player jumps, swings, or slides, while in ""Piggyback Mode"", each player is equipped with their own backpack and can hide in the other player's backpack if the action becomes too intense, such as when jumping over a chasm.[15]

Creatures,,2002,Elo Interactive,Swing! Deutschland,PAL,NaN,"Basic gameplay consists of hatching some creatures, usually norns, and guiding them to reach maturity and to breed more creatures, with the goal of a more intelligent future population.[57] Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it.  After a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature may choose to obey.[58]  The player cannot force creatures to do anything.[59] The player is represented by a disembodied hand in the world, and the hand can attempt to teach creatures by tickling them as a reward or punishing creatures by slapping them.[58]  (For Creatures Village, aimed at very young players, tickling is done by a feather wand, and punishment is represented by a squirt bottle.[60][61]) Older norns can also teach concepts to younger norns.[62] Norns may also express to the player how they are feeling. The language aspect was incorporated to promote a relationship between norns and players,[63] allowing players to anthropomorphise their creatures.[64] A complete life cycle is modelled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with their own particular needs.[65] Breeding is depicted in the game as ""a delicate affair"", and is shown in the game by ""a long kissing sound followed by a pop"".[66] The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures. Death has real consequences - the individual norns do not return after they die.[65] All creatures are bipedal, but there are some variant appearances that are genetically-linked.[4] Some alternate play styles include ""wolfling runs"", where the player may not intervene in their creatures' lives,[67] or even norn torture.[68] Trying to selectively breed or engineer certain traits into the population is also popular, for example, coloured creatures, norns with a better immune system,[13][69] or a less-aggressive grendel.
A Norn is an AIL (Artificial intelligent life) species, the development and survival of which constitute the main thematic elements of the program.
Norns are playful, all-trusting, naive creatures that love to explore. This is often the reason for their downfall, suffering, and death. They are more susceptible to disease in comparison to Ettins and Grendels, and in old age they may fall prey to a wasting disease that prevents them from absorbing certain nutrients.
Grand wished Norns to be endearing and for players to keep them as pets - that they should be independent and stubborn, like toddlers, that the design of the norn should be appealing to as many people as possible, and that the player should care about the norns.[70] Reviewers have compared the Norns' visual design to the Mogwai of the Gremlins film series.[30][71] The Shee originally created the Norns as a mixture of valet and pet. According to the Creatures Labs website, they spread across the galaxy through the Warp and evolved into various variations, including but not restricted to: Toxic Norn,[72] Treehugger Norn[73] and Magma Norns.[74] The spread of Norns throughout the galaxy is related to the mysterious disappearance of the Shee from Albia (from the point of view of the Norns). It may also be a sign of how the Shee fared in their attempt to find a habitable planet.
In the games, the Norns have their own simulated biochemistry, haploid genetics, and neural network to serve as a brain. From Creatures 2 onwards, Norns also possess organs determined by their genetics;[33] mutation and injury can render these defunct, with typically fatal consequences. Each of these has grown somewhat over the course of the series, allowing the creatures to become more complex and intelligent. Norns are omnivores and eat a variety of foods, including carrots, lemons, seeds, insects, fish, honey, and other things. The Norns that the player starts with require some degree of training and discipline from the player in order to make good decisions to maintain their health; however, later on they can evolve to be more independent and hardy, with better-developed instincts and a more robust biochemistry. The player can take advantage of this to breed certain colours or traits through artificial selection, and through many generations the changes can become quite pronounced.
Norns are very social animals,[75] sometimes to the extent that they will prefer to play with other norns than to eat.[76][77]
The Shee are a race of absent-minded scientists. They are the original inhabitants of Albia, and the creators of the Norns, Ettins, and Grendels.
The Shee are all inventors, and make most of their inventions to save time on tasks that would have taken but a few minutes otherwise.[78]
Most of their discoveries are made by accident, and as such, they sequenced their own DNA and eliminated all genetic defects, before discovering the wheel.
Millennia ago, the Shee had left the disk-shaped world of Albia, as they desired to live on a ""more spherical world"". They created the Shee Ark, took along some Norns, Ettins, and various animals and plants, and set out for their new home. The Shee Ark, like all Shee spacecraft, was itself a living creature grown from scratch, and used ""Bioenergy"" (the energy of living things, used to balance the game) to perform its various functions.
Early concepts of the Shee had them as merely a more advanced life form than the Norns, not their creators.[79]
Ettins are a species in Creatures 2 and Creatures 3.
Ettins were created by the Shee to help them on their experiments, especially when using machinery. They made them like machines so much, they tend to steal bits for themselves, often taking them to wherever they consider their home.
C2 Ettins behave rather differently; they tend to lead a sad and lonely life underground with no one but Pitz and the occasional Grendel for company. The backstory in the guides and manual, as well as the opening sequence, reveals that they once lived in the desert at the top of Albia and, true to their nature, built the pyramid that sits there. The actual use (if any) of the pyramid is unknown.
Ettins were introduced into the Creatures series in C2,[80] having been revealed to the world after the volcanic eruption.
An early concept of the Ettins described them as insignificant ""small, lizard-like creatures"", who were often kept as pets by Norns.[28]
The Ettins in Creatures 2 were infertile; however, in Creatures 3, there were two Ettins aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both female), and it was possible to get them to breed if two of them were placed in the Gene Splicer machine to create a male Ettin.
An in-depth exploration of the genetics and neurology of the Ettins in Creatures 2 revealed that they were constantly in pain, apparently by design. This discovery was met by fan uproar.
Grendels are the green-skinned, red-eyed antagonists of the Norns, over which the player has little control, stealing food and injuring individual Norns. They also carry diseases harmful to Norns.[13]  The early concepts of their appearance described them as ""resembling a huge, titanium spider"".[28]
In the unmodified Creatures 1 and 2, Grendels do not reproduce, being born infertile. Generally, only one Grendel is alive in the world of Albia at a time. In Creatures 3, two Grendels were alive aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both male), but it was possible to get them to breed and have offspring if both were placed in the Gene Splicer machine and used to create a female Grendel.
In all three games, Grendels are automatically produced by a ""Mother"" machine; in Creatures 3, however, it is possible to ensure that there are no Grendels in the game by killing any existing grendels (e.g. in the airlock) and then waiting by the mother, then placing any eggs into water (the piranha pool) so that they cannot hatch.
The Grendels were another genetically engineered creation of the Shee, albeit an accidental one. They were certainly not what the Shee were trying to get as a result from their experiments, and were considered to be harmful, useless monsters. However, some of the evil Shee (known as the Banshee) believed the Grendels were genetically superior to the Norns, and kept some for improvement.
It is possible to cross a Norn with a Grendel, creating a 'Grenorn'.[81][82]
The Creatures community has appeared to adopt the Grendel as an underdog figure, creating a ""Grendel Liberation Front"" - despite being intended to add stress to Norns' lives, players began to tame their Grendels.[13]
In each of the games, players interact with the world through the use of a graphical hand as the player's mouse in the main visual area of the game. In Creatures and Creatures 2, players can use applets in a toolbar, often called Kits, along the top of the game window, to access many functions, such as getting their first norn eggs, naming and photographing their norns, monitoring the health and general biochemistry of the norns and administering medicines, monitoring pregnancies, injecting objects into the world, and recording deceased norns.[83][84] Creatures 2 introduced an Ecology Kit and Neuroscience Kit.[85]
In Creature 3 and Docking Station, players still use a hand as their mouse to interact with creatures and the world, but the main game area does not have toolbars like in Creatures and Creatures 2, but instead has areas along the sides of the screens with buttons that the user can press to move to different locations, view the current creatures in the world, manage an inventory of items, and change game settings.
Charlie Brooker regarded the level of detail shown in the monitoring kits as ""terrifying"",[86] and it has been argued that the detailed monitoring kits highlight the artificiality of the norns.[87] Peter Smith disliked the limitation of C1 that the player is ""limited to seeing areas that you've tagged as favorite places or that are currently inhabited by Norns,"" and found it difficult to correctly reward and punish the creatures.[88] Creatures 2 introduced an angel and devil glyph which appears next to the hand to show you whether you are about to reward or punish your creature.[85] Jim Brumbaugh, in reviewing Creatures, disliked the amount of typing that was needed to communicate with the creatures, but found the menu system ""highly user friendly."" He noted also that there was only one way that the player could save, when the player exited the game.[89] Eddie Walou praised the simplified user interface of Creatures 4, saying that earlier games felt like you had to have your BAC to understand.[90] Kahn Lusth, writing for Canard PC, enjoyed the new interface of Creatures Online for communicating with creatures, where with a click of the mouse the player can choose suggestions to guide their creatures, describing it as more convenient than typing keywords.[91] To improve the ergonomics on the iOS system, a 'rubber-band' system has been created for Creatures Online, where the player draws a line between the norn and an object. When the finger is lifted, the available instructions appear.[92]
While the initial pitch was for a desktop pet that could interact with other Windows programs, for example, Windows Media Player,[23] as the game developed, the need for a self-contained world became more apparent. The world was named ""Albia"", after Albion, and one of the goals of gameplay became to explore Albia.[25][79]  Grand thought that having the creatures inhabit a rich, ""messy"", world, and to be able to interact with it in many ways would help creatures' personalities to emerge.[14] The backdrop for Creatures was created by taking photographs of a physical model of the world,[27] part of which is now housed at The Centre for Computing History.[93]
The world is rendered in 2.5D, and the world can smoothly scroll to follow a creature. The world contains many different items, which creatures can interact with in a variety of ways. Objects are written using an object-oriented programming technique - each item has their own scripts which determine how they interact with creatures and with other objects. Objects are detected by a creature by being in its line of sight, which excites a neuron dedicated to that class of objects.[7]  The object-oriented approach means that the games are highly modifiable.[59] Some of the items in the world are dangerous to norns.[94]
In Creatures 2, the environment became more complex, with a ""Complete working eco-system, including weather, seasons and a functioning food-chain. The plants seed and spread around the environment if conditions allow. The result of this is a very ""real"" feeling world that adapts around the player.""[33]
In Creatures 3 and Docking Station, the game was set on a spaceship. The environment became more segmented into areas called ""metarooms"", small biomes, each with their own ecosystem. Players could download and add new metarooms to their games.[95][96]

George explores the rest of the ship before returning to the hold, where the level ends as the ship arrives at its destination.
Following Ted off the ship, George rides on the top of cars and follows Ted's cab through the city, before arriving at a construction site. Navigating through the construction site, George spots Ted entering his apartment building, and makes his way inside Ted's room by climbing the balconies. Upon his arrival, his scent attracts the attention of Ivan, the building's doorman who enforces a ""no pets"" policy. George moves through the apartment to avoid Ivan, before entering the penthouse of Ms. Plushbottom, leading to the second minigame. George is then discovered and evicted from the apartment along with Ted.
The next level takes place at the museum where Ted works; he dodges questions regarding the size of the idol as George sneaks through the museum. Junior (voiced by David Cross), the son of the museum's owner, becomes suspicious after Ted repeatedly mentions a monkey, and sets out to find George. George's repeated antics eventually send a frustrated Junior home, but George and Ted are kicked out regardless after the monkey accidently destroys an Apatosaurus skeleton. Left with nowhere to sleep, the duo take refuge in a park, where they find solace in the fireflies, which George collects. 
The next day, George collects tokens in the final minigame by popping balloons with a group of children; he tries to buy a balloon with the tokens, but ends up taking the entire bunch and floating away, to Ted's horror. This leads to the next level, where George dodges obstacles while floating through the air, collecting balloons to sustain himself. George then lands himself on the ground, only to be captured by animal control and sent back on a ship to Africa. Luckily, Ted rescues George aboard the ship, but then has his idol stolen by a rat. George chases the rat through the ship, and comforts a musophobic sailor through dance. On deck, the idol is swooped up by a seagull; George distracts the bird by offering up a stolen potato, and recovers the idol.
In the final two levels, George and Ted find themselves back in Africa, with Ted realizing the tiny idol was only the key to a larger one. Together, they navigate the various puzzles guarding the path to the idol, some of which prove to be dangerous. The game ends as George opens the entrance to idol, with the final cutscene from the film showing Ted presenting the idol at the museum, and emphasizing the importance of curiosity on his journey with George. 
","Curious George is a platform game where the player controls George, a monkey who can jump, swing and slide around different environments. The game features 13 linear levels, closely following the plot of the film; each level features cutscenes taken from the film.[2] Each level features collectible bananas, with the main goal being to collect idols, which advance the player to the next part of the level.[2][3] The player may also be tasked with finding hidden key objects in order to advance.[4] The levels also feature a series of highlighted objects, which award the player curious points for interacting with them.[3] These points can then be used to unlock bonus items, which include hats that George can wear in-game, and the ability to replay minigames and cutscenes.[5]
The game features four minigames, three of which are fairly similar, requiring the player to press a button at the correct time.[5] The first is a rhythm game featuring George dancing to a beat.[4] The final minigame involves breaking balloons, with the player having to complete 18 rounds of the game to collected the tokens needed to complete the level.[2][5]

Custom Robo GX,,2002,Noise,Nintendo,JP,NaN,"Unlike every other Custom Robo title in the series, the Custom Robo battles in Custom Robo GX are in 2D, instead of 3D, due to the Game Boy Advance not being powerful enough to completely emulate other Custom Robo titles. Also, in its storyline, players can't move the protagonist the same way they can in any other title of the series. In this title, the main character the players name is used as the cursor on the map screen for selecting which place to enter. When the players are inside a place, a pop-up window will give the players choices on what to do inside the place the players are in.
The main object of the whole game is to finish its plot by collecting every Custom Robo, battle part, and other stuff that the player wants, while winning every battle that moves the players from one part of the storyline to the next. In Custom Robo battles, the object is to reduce the hit points of the players' opponent from 1000 to 0 by using different Custom Robos, guns, bombs, pods, and Action-Chips. The exclusive Action-Chip within this version allows the players to create an additional shield of defense or to expand on the players' various maneuvers. It is confirmed in this game that many upon many of combinations are present when it comes to the players' specific weapon. This combinational process however is strengthened even greater with the new Action-Chip ability. Battles begin with the players' robo being launched out of a Robocannon which is controlled with the D-pad.
Unlike other Custom Robo titles, once shot out of the Robocannon, players have a random amount of time for their Custom Robo to be ready to battle, instead of depending on which six sides of the cube they land on. Custom Robos are arranged in groups that are similar to their abilities. In camera views, unlike other Custom Robo titles, this one has only one, which zooms out whenever two Custom Robos are far from each other, while it zooms in whenever they are close to each other. The endurance bar is located above the players' hit points. Once it runs out, the players' robo gets ""downed"" which means that it stays fallen for a couple seconds. After it gets up, it goes into ""rebirth"", where it stays invincible for about 3 seconds. If the player repeatedly loses the same battle, the game offers the option of reducing the opponent's initial health, to make it easier. If the players continue to lose several times, the degree of handicap offered increases up to 75%, giving the opponent a starting 250 HP.

Daredevil,No,2003,Griptonite Games,BAM!,"NA, PAL","Daredevil's largest role was as the title character in the Game Boy Advance game based on the 2003 film.[2]
Stick appears as a supporting character. In the beginning of the game, he informs Daredevil that the Kingpin has put a price on Daredevil's head. After Daredevil defeats Kirigi, he mentions that the Kingpin has a mysterious connection to the Sewer King. When Daredevil beats Echo, he warns Daredevil that Bullseye is waiting for him at a construction site.
Kirigi is a boss in the game. In the game, he believes that Daredevil was working for the Kingpin and he has sent the Daredevil to kill him, since the Hand was at war with the Kingpin's gang. Kirigi is seemingly killed by Daredevil after he defeats him.
Echo is a boss in the video game. In the game, she is a villain, and she believes that Daredevil was never in league with the Kingpin in the first place. After chasing Echo throughout the New York Subway Transit System, Daredevil defeats her.
Bullseye appears as a boss. In this game, he waits for Daredevil at a construction site. Daredevil reveals to Bullseye that the bounty on Daredevil's head was a fraud. Bullseye believes this but he reveals to Daredevil that he was in league with the Kingpin. At the top of the construction site, Daredevil defeats Bullseye. Unlike his movie and comics counterpart, Bullseye uses a handgun as his weapon.
The Kingpin is the final boss in the video game.[3] In the game, he puts out a warrant out for Daredevil's arrest to the criminal underworld (which is later revealed as a fraud). Daredevil interrogates the Kingpin at his penthouse, where it is revealed that Daredevil eliminated his competition when he was setting up his master plan. After Daredevil defeats him, the Kingpin tells him that although Daredevil knows his secret identity, Daredevil cannot reveal Wilson Fisk's secret to the police. At the end, Fisk lies to the reporters by saying that Daredevil's arrest was a ""media distortion"".

Darius R,,2002,"RideonJapan, Inc.",Pacific Century,JP,NaN,"Darius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen is three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet uses an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.[2][3][4][5]

Dark Arena,,2002,Graphic State,Majesco Entertainment,,"The United Arms Organization constructs a top-secret training facility, codenamed Dark Arena, on a small, isolated island.  Genetic splicing was performed to create dangerous Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEOs) that were intended to train troops, under the assurance that special security fail-safe systems would prevent the creatures from breaking free.  However, in the summer of 2146, the failsafes failed, allowing the GEOs to overrun the facility and slaughter its personnel.  
No sooner after this occurs, Angelina Bradshaw and her special operations team are summoned to the island to try and get things back under control, but all of her men are no match for the GEOs, leaving her trapped alone deep in Dark Arena.  She manages to hide for a while to recollect herself and inform authorities of the situation before the GEOs finally find her.  Unwilling to share the fate of her comrades, she begins to battle her way out of Dark Arena and must race against time to clear out a path to a hanger on the outskirts of the island and evacuate before a nuclear strike is called to destroy all GEOs as a last resort.  
The game's ending depends on the difficulty level set by the player.  If the player completes the game on the easiest difficulty, Angelina fails to escape the base alive.  Finishing the game on medium difficulty will see her barely escape.  She makes a better escape if the game is beaten on hard difficulty.

Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2,,2003,Full Fat,Acclaim,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game has several different modes of play.
The first, and main mode is Proquest, a story mode (single player). The player selects a character to portray, and then has several 3 minute runs to complete set goals (ranking from Beginner to Insane), such as grinding 50 meters down a grind bar or scoring 50,000 points in a single run. By completing these quests, the player earns respect points. After collecting enough respect points, they then unlock new areas and bikes. In each new area the set of goals is different. After earning enough points, the player will be invited to a competition, where they have to show their skills at biking by not only scoring high, but also by performing a variety of tricks, modifiers, spins, and grinds. Players can also earn 1000 respect points by finding all the gaps in a particular park. Gaps, as the name implies, are gaps between two items, such as between two jumps, or from one side of a river to another. There are 10 parks total; Woodward camp (9 gaps), Trainyards (23 gaps), Swamp trails (17 gaps), Commercial district (16 gaps), Greenville NC (10 gaps), Galloon water park (13 gaps), HWY 47 Cloverleaf (8 gaps), Devil's peak (18 gaps), Airport garage (11 gaps), Venice Italy (18 gaps).
In Session mode, players take part in 3 minute runs just as with Proquest mode, but without set goals. Players can simply try to score high, or explore different areas of the park, break records, and discover gaps.
In Freeride, players take part in runs without any time limits. This mode is useful if one is just trying to explore all the nooks and crannies of the park or attempting to discover secrets. The player cannot break records or discover gaps, since there is no time limit, and it is technically considered cheating. Therefore, any score gained is disregarded.
The Park Editor is a fairly powerful feature of the game that allows the user to create their own Bikepark to ride in the Session, Multiplayer and Freeride game modes. The park is created by placing premade objects on a blank area of a themed map. Gaps between objects can also be added. The player can then save the park and ride it. Players cannot, however, create goals like the ones featured in Proquest.
Two people can play different game types in this mode, on any level unlocked or created. Being one of the major areas where the game could have used improvement, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 supports only two players at one time, and they must alternate instead of playing simultaneously (as in many other extreme sports titles).  One of the multiplayer games was similar to the basketball game ""HORSE"", with the exception that players can name the game whatever they chose.  The object of the game was to perform a trick, and then the next player would have to perform the same trick, otherwise end up with a letter.  Once the word was complete, the game was over. Another one was called Wipeout. The two players took turns crashing the hardest to get points. Who ever had the most points in a single hit wins.

Defender of the Crown,,20022004,Crawfish Interactive,Metro3D,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game is set in England in 1149 during the Middle Ages where, following the death of the king, different factions are fighting for territorial control.
The player assumes the role of a Saxon (Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword, or Wolfric the Wild) and tries to fight off the Norman hordes and wrestle for control of England. Eventually, the player must fight for control of all territories, and potentially those controlled by other Saxons, if they have become antagonistic. The player must amass armies and fight for control of opponents' castles. The player may engage enemy armies in battle and loot or lay siege to opposing castles. Territories can also be won in the periodic jousting contests. From time to time the player may attempt to rescue a damsel in distress and can appeal for help from the legendary bandit Robin Hood.
The game's strategy boils down to a war of attrition as the player tries to amass larger armies than his opponents and manages to attack their territories at the right time.
Due to financial strains, Cinemaware decided to release the initial version without all the features originally planned for because of their need for revenue. Some features were partially implemented, but were removed so the game could be shipped. Some additional features completed but never seen in the shipped game include flaming fireballs (launched via the catapult), more locations (more varied castles to attack), and more in-depth strategy. Some of these features were implemented in the ports of the game.
James D. Sachs, the primary artist for the game, showcased some of these features on the Amiga during interviews after the release of the game.

Densetsu no Starfy,No,2002,TOSE,Nintendo,JP,"In the beginning, the protagonist, Stafy, known as Starfy in Western regions, was moving things around his home, Pufftop Palace, until he tripped and dropped some things he was moving. One of them fell into the ocean, which was the Magic Jar, an object that seals the antagonist of the game known as Ogura. Meanwhile, a very severe thunderstorm with two tornadoes shook Starfy out of his home into the ocean. Later, Old Man Lobber encountered Starfy, and told him about the Magic Jar and Ogura, while he helped Starfy get back home, by making him do some swimming lessons, as well as giving directions. While Starfy was heading back home, he encountered some people he didn't know before, such as Moe the clam, and decided to help them with their problems, like finding their missing items, defeating enemies, and so on, until Starfy and his friends fought and brought back Ogura into the Magic Jar to restore peace.

Derby Stallion Advance,,2002,ParityBit,Enterbrain,JP,NaN,"The ultimate goal of the player in the Derby Stallion games is to win the title of GI (Group I) Racer. To do this, the player must attempt to develop the greatest stock of horses that he can in order to have the greatest chance at each of the weekday and holiday races that compose the 1-year racing schedule of the fictitious ""SRA"" (an abbreviation of Sonobe Racing Association) group. Between races, the player engages in numerous business simulation, farm simulation, and role-playing activities.
Derby Stallion games have evolved as newer members of the series have been added, allowing players greater and greater control over every aspect of the horse-raising business. As such, the player must now race horses and place racing bets, manage the working of a stables and/or ranch, select different studs and broodmares for breeding, learn to break and train horses, and set up advantageous horse trades or sales, among other duties. Players must also make critical decisions about appropriate ages to race horses, breeds to pursue, and the timing of events to coincide with race dates. As the player improves the stock of his horses, his racing statistics, and his position in the world of the horse business, his Group Ranking increases until he reaches the goal of Group I at which point he has won the game. The games also allow the player to continue playing after the top goal has been met.
Derby Stallion games all feature a single-player mode, however much effort has been put into making the games as versatile as possible for multiplayer capabilities. Multiplayer functions allow players to trade or complete sales between themselves, to set up breeders' agreements, and to race against opponents. To accomplish this, various methods have been used to exchange data from the earliest password code exchange to online connectivity with PCs, Satellaview exchange (via 8MB memory packs and slotted application cartridge), and Randnet service.[2] Other methods of data exchange that have been developed include the Game Boy Transfer Pak (GB64 in Japan) for Nintendo 64[3][4] and telephone satellite connections for players using DoCoMo phones.

Desert Strike Advance,No,2002,Budcat Creations,EA Games,,"The game opens with a self-proclaimed general named Kilbaba (Mubaba in the Super NES version) seizing control of an unnamed, fictional Gulf state. Installing himself as dictator, Kilbaba quickly begins fortifying his position with military weapons and installations, including facilities for building nuclear bombs. The United States decides to send in a single helicopter, piloted by the player's unnamed character and aided by a co-pilot, to infiltrate and destroy Kilbaba's forces in a series of swift strikes.[9]
Altogether, four missions need to be resolved:
The game's plot was felt by commentators to be a thinly disguised reference to the Gulf War, while comparisons were drawn between Kilbaba and Saddam Hussein,[3] and between the game's unnamed desert setting and Iraq.[8][7]
","Desert Strike is a shoot 'em up game in which the player pilots an AH-64 Apache helicopter (albeit modified with a Fenestron rotor). The game is less frantic than typical shoot 'em ups, with the addition of greater strategic elements.[2] The action takes place on open, multi-directional scrolling levels viewed from an isometric perspective.[3] The player views the action from outside the helicopter, rather than from within the cockpit.[4] The player is also assisted by their copilot, who they can pick at the start of the mission; each copilot plays differently with different skill levels. The best copilot, Lt. Carlos ""Jake"" Valdez, is missing in action at the start of the game, and can be found and rescued during one of the missions.[5]
Levels consist of several missions, which are based around the destruction of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel.[6] The Apache is armed with a machine gun, more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation.[4] Enemy weapons range from soldiers with small arms, to anti-aircraft missiles to tanks and armoured cars.[7]

The player's craft has a limited amount of armour, which is depleted as the helicopter is hit by enemy fire. Should the armour reach zero, the craft will be destroyed, costing the player a life. The player must outmanoeuvre enemies to avoid damage, but can replenish armour by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone.[8][6] The helicopter has a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted over time. Should the fuel run out the Apache will crash, again costing the player a life. The craft can refuel by collecting fuel barrels: the player must therefore plan mission routes carefully in order to maximise efficiency. The helicopter also carries limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates.[2] "

Each character only has a handful of special attacks they can perform, with the two action buttons, A and B, allowing them to jump or attack respectively.
Each match is won by collecting small blue/red spheres called ""D-Spirits"". These are obtained by hitting your opponent, which causes a few of them to fly from their body and scatter across the battlefield. Different attacks can produce more spheres to fly out, and the player who has collected the most by the time the round ends wins. Each character can also digivolve into their most powerful or ""Ultimate"" (Mega) form by touching a flying Digimon named Calumon that appears every so often in each stage. This form grants them different, more powerful attacks for a limited time.
As the player advances through each stage, they will occasionally have to battle a character named Impmon. Winning or losing this encounter has no bearing on the actual game progression itself, and only serves to award more points. In the final stage, the Digimon must face off against Millenniummon himself.

Unlike most fighting games, the winner is not determined by having the most health, but the most blue or red ""D-Spirits"", which are released whenever the player strikes an opponent. When the player has damaged the opponent enough to fill the gauge at the top, the character's Beast Spirit is activated whenever they attack, allowing them to temporarily digivolve to a higher level, and attack with greater force. Also, yellow diamonds are released during Beast Spirit attacks, and filling the diamond gauge enables the player to momentarily warp digivolve to Ancient Level and fire a powerful attack, before returning to normal (this depletes the diamond gauge to zero). Once all of the Human Spirit Digimon are defeated, the player must then defeat Cherubimon. Cherubimon's name is Kerpymon in this game.
There is also a mini-game, where Digimon are used like marbles, and are fired at other Digimon on the board to knock them out of the arena.

Digimon Racing,Yes,2004,Griptonite Games,Bandai,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Digimon Racing is a racing video game that utilizes characters and elements from Digimon as well as those of traditional racing games. The game follows a group of Digimon competing in a racing tournament within the Digital World, home to all Digimon. The purpose of the grand prix is to determine who is the best racer; thus, they use specially designed karts that equate all contestants in terms of ability.[2]
Digimon Racing's gameplay largely resembles that of traditional racing games. It focuses on competing against seven CPU-controlled characters in cup races consisting of three laps. The usage of items to attack opponents and improve one's own condition is an integral part of the gameplay, and adds an element of kart racing games.[3] A new feature in the game is ""kart hopping"": using the karts to jump onto opponents, slowing them down. This adds an element of action gameplay. Digivolution, a recurring theme in Digimon, also plays a role in the game. Driving over energy hotspots scattered throughout the tracks increases an energy meter located at the bottom left of the game's HUD. As the meter increases, the player traverses the Digimon's evolutionary line, becoming more powerful and ultimately gaining the ability to use a special attack.[4]
The game's fifteen tracksâfour of which are available immediatelyâare based on conventional video game environments such as jungles, volcanoes, and cities. After completing a track for the first time, the player unlocks a time trial mode for this track, and a boss battle. The action-oriented boss battles involve defeating a generally static Digimon using items scattered throughout the areas, which are not designed as race tracks.[4] The player can also compete in single races unrelated to the story in any unlocked tracks.[5] The game uses the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter or Game Link Cable accessories for a multiplayer racing mode supporting up to four players.[4]
The game features eleven Digimon as playable characters. Eight characters are available immediately; the rest are unlockable by completing cup races.[5] However, the Digivolution mechanic increases the total number of playable Digimon to over 40.[6] The cast predominantly includes popular Digimon from the Digimon anime.[2] Characters' racing abilities differ through their ranking in three areas: speed, handling and acceleration.[7]

Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates,,2002,RFX Interactive,TDK Mediactive,"NA, PAL","Clayton has finished his Skybax training when his friends Hyla, a human female, and Krekor, a Hadrosaur, inform him of a threat to Dinotopia.  A band of pirates are stealing and hiding Tyrannosaurus eggs all over the island, attempting to draw the creatures from their nesting grounds so they can search for an artifact of some sort.  Clayton is given a Sunstone Prod, a device similar to a staff, to use against the pirates as he hunts for the eggs.
As the game progresses, it becomes apparent that the pirates are after the Timestone, a mythical artifact said to slow time around whoever holds it.  Clayton must race to find all of the remaining eggs and locate the Timestone before the pirates do.
Each level takes place in a different part of Dinotopia.  After three sections of each level, Clayton faces an extra challenge, usually a boss to fight, and then must return the eggs he recovered to the Tyrannosaur nesting area without getting killed before proceeding to the next level.
","For the first two levels Clayton uses his Sunstone Prod with three different sunstones: Laser Sunstone, which shoots a laser at enemies, Flash Sunstone, which temporarily blinds enemies, and Earthquake sunstone, which eliminates all visible enemies.  Clayton can also swing the Prod like a club at close range.
At the third level, the gameplay changes as Clayton flies in Canyon City, pilots the Remora underwater and runs with Kreekor in the Diamond Caverns.  In the final challenges of the second and fifth levels, Clayton must use his prod against his mechanized enemies, but cannot use any sunstones.

Within each stage, Aladdin defeats foes by jumping on them or disorienting them by throwing apples while avoiding dangerous obstacles. Gems can be collected to gain extra lives and points, and 10 red gems located within each stage will substantially increase the player's score.

Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire,,2001,3d6 Games,THQ,"NA, PAL","A mysterious explosion sends a tsunami towards the city of Atlantis. During the evacuation, the Queen of Atlantis is lifted up into a strange floating crystal, leaving behind her distraught daughter Kida. The crystal merges with the Queen and creates a dome preserving the city's innermost district, and Atlantis sinks beneath the waves.
Nearly 8,000 years later, in 1914, Milo Thatch â a marginalized linguist at the Smithsonian Institution â discovers the existence of ""the Shepherd's Journal"", a manuscript containing directions to Atlantis. After Milo's proposal to search for the Journal is rejected by the museum board, a mysterious woman, Helga Sinclair, introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the Journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's late grandfather, and recruits Milo to decipher the journal and join an expedition to Atlantis.
The expedition is headed by Commander Rourke, who also led the Journal recovery expedition. The crew includes Helga; Vinny, a demolitions expert; MoliÃ¨re, a geologist; Dr. Sweet, a medical officer; Audrey, a mechanic; Mrs. Packard, a radio operator; Cookie, a mess cook; and several trained soldiers. They set out in the massive submarine ""Ulysses"", but are attacked by a mechanical leviathan that guards Atlantis' entrance. The ""Ulysses"" is destroyed, leaving only a handful of survivors. Following the journal's instructions, they enter a cavern and travel through a dormant volcano, where they are met by Kida, miraculously still alive and young. She and the other Atlanteans have forgotten their written language, and the society has languished, but they can understand English due to spoken Atlantean being the basis for many modern languages. 
Against her father's wishes, Kida enlists Milo to help Atlantis regain its old glory, and leads him to an underwater mural in the sunken part of the city. Milo learns from the mural that ""The Heart of Atlantis"" provides the people there with longevity, and once powered their devices, via smaller crystals they all wear. He discovers a page of the Shepherd's Journal, which also contained this information, is missing. Returning to the surface, he is confronted by Rourke, who reveals he has the missing page. He and the crew capture Milo and Kida, and Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis demanding to know where the Heart is. However, he eventually finds it for himself beneath the palace. The giant crystal, sensing a threat, merges with Kida, and Rourke puts her in a crate, intending to sell her at the surface.
Milo reveals to his friends that the Atlanteans will die if the Heart is removed, and most of them find their consciences will not let them help Rourke. Rourke, Helga, and the soldiers leave the rest behind and start for the surface. The dying King gives Milo his own crystal, and explains he once attempted to create weapons from the Heart, causing the past explosion and the death of his wife. He also explains the crystal must have a royal host when the city is in danger, and begs Milo to save Atlantis. 
Milo and his friends rally the Atlanteans to reactivate their machinery, and pursue and attack the mercenaries. Rourke and Helga have a falling-out during the battle, and he throws her into the dormant volcano. As she dies, she shoots the airship containing Kida's crate. Milo and Rourke fight on the burning airship over the Heart, and Milo slashes Rourke with a crystal-charged shard of glass, turning Rourke into a living crystal statue which disintegrates when struck. The burning airship crash-lands and awakens the volcano. Milo and the rest flee back to Atlantis with Kida, who, still merged with the crystal, rises into the sky and awakens ancient Stone Guardians, who raise the flooded portion of Atlantis into the dome and protect the entire city from the lava flow. The Crystal then returns Kida, alive, to Milo. 
Milo elects to stay in Atlantis with Kida, with whom he has fallen in love, and the rest return to the surface, promising to keep their adventures secret to preserve Atlantis' safety. Whitmore alone learns the truth, from photographs taken by Mrs. Packard.

Disney's Home on the Range,,2004,Artificial Mind and Movement,Disney Interactive Studios,"NA, PAL","Maggie is the only cow left on the Dixon Ranch after Alameda Slim (a wanted cattle rustler) stole all the rest of Mr. Dixon's cattle. Dixon has no other choice than to sell Maggie to Pearl Gesner, a kind, aging woman who runs a small farm called Patch of Heaven. Sam Brown, the local Sheriff arrives to tell Pearl that her bank is cracking down on debtors. Pearl has three days to pay the bank $750, or her farm will be sold to the highest bidder. Hearing this, Maggie convinces the other cows on the farm (Grace, a happy-go-lucky character, and Mrs. Calloway, who has had leadership go to her head) to go to town to attempt winning prize money at a fair. While the cows are in town, a bounty hunter named Rico (whom Buck, the Sheriff's horse, idolizes) drops a criminal off and collects the reward. Stating he needs a replacement horse to go after Alameda Slim while his own horse rests, he takes Buck. When Maggie finds out that the reward for capturing Slim is exactly $750, she convinces the other cows to try to capture him to save Patch of Heaven.
That night, they hide among a large herd of steers, when Alameda Slim appears. Before any of them can do anything, Slim begins a yodeling song which sends all the cattle (except Grace, who is tone deaf) into a trance that causes them to dance madly and follow Slim anywhere. Grace is able to bring Maggie and Mrs. Calloway back to their senses just before Slim closes the path behind him with a rock-slide to stop Rico and his men from chasing him. As Rico discusses with his men what his next move will be, Buck starts talking with Maggie, Grace, and Mrs. Calloway as old friends and miming actions. This causes Rico to believe Buck is frightened by cows, so he sends Buck back to the Sheriff. Buck escapes, determined to capture Slim for himself to prove his worth.
Maggie, Grace, and Mrs. Calloway continue their search for Slim, determined to pass Buck and get to Slim first, but they have a fallout when they lose the trail in a flash flood. Mrs. Calloway accuses Maggie of wanting to go after Slim only as a personal vendetta, arguing that she and Grace are better off without Maggie. The three spend the night under a large rock, with Maggie deciding to leave the next morning while Grace and Mrs. Calloway decide to return to Patch of Heaven to say their final farewells. The next morning, however, they are awakened by a peg-legged jackrabbit named Lucky Jack, who has also lost his home, an old mine, to Alameda Slim. Maggie decides to go after Slim with Lucky Jack in tow, but Grace convinces Mrs. Calloway that they help. Lucky Jack leads the three cows to Slim's lair in Echo Mine. At the mine, Slim reveals that he has been stealing all cattle from his former patrons. When his former patrons can no longer support their land, Slim buys the land when it is auctioned off, under the guise of the respectable-looking Yancy O'Dell, using the very money he gets from selling the cattle he stole.
After arriving at Slim's lair, the cows capture Slim. They run off with Slim's accomplices and buyer in pursuit on a steam train. Rico arrives. When the chase stops, Rico is revealed to work for Slim. Crushed by this, Buck decides to help the cows and fights Rico while setting the other cattle free. Slim dons his Yancy O'Dell costume and leaves the cows stranded in the middle of the desert with the train, while he goes to attend the auction. However, the cows arrive using the train to the farm and expose Slim. Slim is arrested, and Patch of Heaven is saved by the reward money.
A few weeks pass, and at the county fair, most of the livestock on Patch of Heaven have won prizes. Lucky Jack moves in with Jebb the Goat, and two steer and Slim's charming and gentlemanly steed Junior the Buffalo arrive unexpectedly to live at Patch of Heaven, expanding the farm.

He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the family's Benbow Inn, and derives amusement from ""Alponian solar cruising"": skysurfing atop a rocket-powered sailboard.
One day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, Billy Bones, gives Jim a sphere and tells him to ""beware the cyborg"". Suddenly, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn to the ground while Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler flee. At Doppler's study, Jim discovers that the sphere is a holographic projector containing a star map, leading to the location of Treasure Planet. Despite Sarah's reluctance, Jim and Doppler decide to travel to Treasure Planet in order to gain the funds to rebuild the inn.
Doppler commissions the ship RLS Legacy on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined first mate, Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook John Silver, whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph, to prevent Jim discovering the crew's mutinous intentions. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship.
During the voyage, the ship encounters a supernova and Jim secures the  lifelines of all the crew members. As a black hole forms from the supernova, the ruthless and aggressive insectoid crew member Scroop secretly cuts Mr. Arrow's lifeline, who falls to his death in the black hole. The ship manages to ride the shock waves to safety, and the crew mourns the loss of Arrow while Jim is framed for not securing Arrow's lifeline properly. Jim is later comforted by Silver, who knows that Scroop is responsible for Arrow's death.
As the ship reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears the crew and soon discovers they are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a mutiny erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph prepare to abandon the ship. Jim retrieves the map and Silver targets him, but cannot bring himself to shoot Jim and allows him to escape with the others. The group are shot down during their escape, injuring Amelia, and they discover that the map was actually Morph in disguise, the map being left on the ship in a coil of rope Morph had taken the map to.
While exploring Treasure Planet's forests, they soon meet B.E.N., an abandoned navigational robot who has lost his primary memory and invites them to his home for shelter. The pirates corner the group there.  Using a secret passage, Jim, Morph, and B.E.N. hijack a longboat to fly back to the Legacy in an attempt to retrieve the map. Scroop, who is guarding the ship, becomes aware of their presence and attacks. When the artificial gravity is disabled during the struggle, Scroop attempts to cut Jim loose of the ship, but Jim succeeds in kicking him overboard to float to his death in deep space. They obtain the map, but upon returning they are caught by Silver and his crew, who have already captured Doppler and Amelia.
Silver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens to any location in the universe, which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal to the center of Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really an ancient machine that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure, but trip a hidden sensor as they enter the core of the planet. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint had rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. The planet soon begins to fall apart. Not wanting to go empty-handed, Silver attempts to escape on Flint's ship loaded with a fraction of the treasure, but eventually lets it go to save Jim's life. The survivors escape back to the Legacy, but it gets damaged and is unable to escape the planet's atmosphere in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to the Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the crew safely clear the planet's explosion just in time.
Jim finds Silver below decks about to escape his impending judgment. He allows him to go, and Silver asks him to keep Morph, as well as providing him a handful of the treasure he managed to save to rebuild the Benbow Inn, believing Jim will ""rattle the stars"". Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt inn; Doppler and Amelia have married and had children of their own, and Jim, having matured under Silver's mentorship, has become an interstellar cadet. Jim looks into the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.

By holding the trigger, the character's fist will clamp shut, grasping anything in its range. Pegs and pegboards are positioned throughout the environment for characters to grasp, allowing the player to climb and traverse their surroundings. Grasping a peg with the character's right or left hand will respectively cause them to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise around it, and the player must use their spinning momentum to propel them through the air. Both the triggers and the D-pad can be used to affect horizontal character movement while airborne or on the ground. Pressing both triggers at once will cause the character to jump, while holding the triggers will cause them to store up power, after which they will perform a charge attack when the triggers are released. This can be used to attack enemies or cross longer gaps. Players can also perform other tasks with their character's hands in combination with their spinning momentum, such as turning cranks, pulling levers, and throwing rocks at distant enemies.

Scattered across each stage are bananas for Donkey Kong to collect, which the player can spend at any time during gameplay to recover Donkey Kong's health or grant him temporary invincibility. Players can find one of 20 Crystal Coconuts hidden in each stage, which are used to unlock bonus content. A stolen medal can also be found in nearly every stage, as well as earned from defeating each boss. Completing the game with all 24 medals collected will unlock ""Diddy Mode"", a more difficult version of Adventure where the player controls Diddy Kong. A time attack mode for the Adventure stages can also be unlocked.

Dokapon: Monster Hunter NA|Dokapon: Monster Hunter! PAL|Dokapon-Q: Monster Hunter! JP,,20012002,"Asmik Ace Entertainment, Inc",AIA,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Dokapon takes place on Dokkano Island, in the town of Poponga. The goal of the game is to become a licensed adventurer - to do this, the player must pass an adventurer's exam by completing a number of assigned missions, which requires the player to defeat many monsters in battle. Once weakened, the player can collect the monster and use it in future battles to defeat opponents, as with other games such as PokÃ©mon.
Dungeons are randomly generated each time the player enters them. Staircases allow the player to move between floors in the dungeons. Within the dungeons are scattered items, weapons, and shields which may be used or sold once the dungeon is completed. Aside from the treasures are monsters. Some will chase you, some will wander freely, some run from you.
If the player encounters a monster, a battle begins. The battle starts off with the choice of one card. Two cards are face down; one contains a sword while the other contains a shield. The sword card is the attack card and whoever gets that card will attack first. The shield card determines who will defend first. The battle will then start. The battle commands are based on a rock-paper-scissors game and include a sword or shield according to what turn you have. The sword icon is a normal attack using the weapon you currently have. If the character is unarmed, this is the only command available. This does a set amount of damage based on the character's attack and the opponents defense. Attacks can be evaded depending on the speed stat.
The sword icon is the main attack. This deals out a set amount of damage. The damage can only be lowered if the opponent uses the shield command. But the attack can still deal a good amount of damage. The rock, scissors, and paper commands will contain other moves which you may use. If you win, you will use that move. If you lose, your move is canceled and the opponent uses their defensive move. Strategy is key when using the commands as you may have a big disadvantage.
The shield icon is the main defense. You will be dealt all damage if the enemy uses a rock, scissors, or paper based move. You'll take less damage if they use the sword icon but many times the monster won't. The rock, scissors, and paper commands are different and have many different effects. Some reflect the attack or back with full effect or a lower effect, some give your character higher stats or decrease the monsters stats, some don't do anything at all.

Donald Duck Advance,No,2001,Ubisoft Shanghai,Disney Interactive Studios,"NA, PAL, JP","Goin' Quackers begins with Donald Duck, Gladstone Gander, and Gyro Gearloose watching television reporter Daisy Duck discovering the mysterious temple of the evil magician Merlock. As she tells the story, she is kidnapped by Merlock. His arch-rival Gladstone sets out to find her before Donald, who decides to use Gyro's new invention, the ""Tubal Teleport System"", to track down Merlock and Daisy. However, the machine does not have enough power to get there and for it to reach Merlock's lair, Donald must go on a journey to plant an antenna at certain locations in order to boost the machine's power. Along the way, he must compete with Gladstone, reverse the spells that Merlock put on Huey, Dewey, and Louie's toys, and defeat several bosses, including the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell. In the end, Donald is able to locate Merlock; he defeats him and rescues Daisy. The temple collapses, but Gyro is able to teleport them back to his lab, where Donald receives a kiss from Daisy for saving her.
","Goin' Quackers's gameplay is very similar to that of Crash Bandicoot, and requires the player to move through various settings in 24 levels in four warp rooms. The four level themes are Duckie Mountain, Duckburg, Magica DeSpell's Manor, and Merlock's Temple. Donald Duck has to dodge various enemies and obstacles throughout the levels and defeat bosses at the end of each warp room. There are also bonus levels where Donald Duck has to outrun a bear, a truck with an evil face, a ghost hand, and a statue head, respectively. The viewpoint of the levels can change between a 2D side-scrolling perspective and a 3D perspective. Re-doing the levels in order to defeat Gladstone's time in same, gives the player advantages in the game.
The player has four lives that can increase by finding special items. Each life gives Donald two opportunities to be touched by the enemy; the first time is touched, he becomes angry and throws berserk to the enemies, the second time, he loses a life. Donald can also unlock new outfits, which alter cutscenes and idle animations (such as Donald taking photos of the place if he is dressed like a tourist).

Donkey Kong Country|Super Donkey Kong JP,Yes,2003,Rare,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","Donkey Kong Country is a reboot of the Donkey Kong franchise,[8] set long after the events of Donkey Kong (1981) and Donkey Kong Jr. (1982). The original Donkey Kong grows old, moves to Donkey Kong Island, and takes on the moniker Cranky Kong, passing the ""Donkey Kong"" mantle down to his grandson.[9] One night, the Kremlings, led by King K. Rool, invade Donkey Kong Island and steal the Kongs' hoard of bananas. Donkey, alongside his nephew Diddy, sets out on a journey to reclaim the banana hoard and defeat the Kremlings.[5]
The two Kongs travel throughout Donkey Kong Island, battling the Kremlings and their henchmen, before reaching K. Rool's pirate ship, the Gang-Plank Galleon. The two take on K. Rool and seemingly defeat him, initiating a mock credits roll claiming that the Kremlings developed the game, but K. Rool gets back up to continue the fight.[10][11] However, the Kongs persevere, defeat K. Rool, and reclaim the banana hoard.[12]
","Donkey Kong Country is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player must complete 40 levels[2] to recover the Kongs' banana hoard, which has been stolen by the crocodilian Kremlings. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes. In single-player, the player controls one of two characters: the gorilla Donkey Kong or his monkey nephew Diddy Kong, switching between the two as necessary. Both characters offer different attributes: Donkey is stronger and can defeat enemies more easily, whilst Diddy moves faster and is more agile.[2][3] Both playable Kongs can walk, run, jump, roll, pick up and throw certain objects, while Donkey can pound the terrain to defeat enemies or find items.[4] Multiplayer modes include the competitive ""Contest"" mode or the cooperative ""Team"" mode.[2] In Contest, each player controls their own set of Kongs but with different colors to differentiate between players and take turns playing each level as quickly as possible; the objective is to complete the most levels in the fastest time. In Team mode, each player takes the role of one of the two Kongs and play as a tag team.
The player navigates through the game via two game screens: the overworld map and a side-scrolling playfield which comprises the majority of the game. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of Donkey Kong Island and provides access to levels. Each level on the map is marked with an icon: unfinished levels are marked by Kremlings, whilst completed areas are marked by Donkey or Diddy. The overworld also grants the player the opportunity to visit other members of the Kong family: Funky Kong operates flight services which allows the player to travel back and forth between different areas of the game, jumping in Candy Kong's ""save barrels"" gives the player the chance to save their progress, and encountering Cranky Kong in his cabins provide the player with tips and fourth wall-breaking humour.[5]
The majority of the game takes place in linear levels, populated with various obstacles and enemies, which mostly involve the player traversing the stages by running, jumping, or defeating enemies by jumping on their heads or rolling into them. If the player is hit by an enemy, the leading Kong runs off-screen, automatically enabling the player to take control of the other. They will only be able to control that Kong unless they free the other Kong from a barrel.[6] The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if both Donkey and Diddy come into contact with an enemy or fall into bottomless pits. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although they may continue their game from the most recent save point. Some levels feature unique mechanics such as riding in mine carts, launching out of barrel cannons, or swinging from vine to vine. Each level features various items for the player to collect; these include bananas, golden letters that spell out KâOâNâG, extra life balloons, and golden animal tokens that lead to bonus stages. Collecting 100 bananas or all four K-O-N-G letters will give the player an extra life respectively. There are also secret paths that lead to bonus games where the player can earn additional lives or other items, as well as gain possible shortcuts through the level.[5][7] Each section of the map has one boss at the end, which must be defeated to advance through different parts of the overworld.
In certain levels, the player can gain assistance from the Kong's five ""animal buddies"" found by breaking open unique crates.[7] Animals provide boons such as extra speed or jump height. Each animal can be found in an appropriately themed level: for example, Enguarde, a swordfish that can defeat enemies with its bill, can only be found underwater, while Squawks, a parrot that carries a lantern, is found in one cave level. Other ""animal buddies"" include Rambi, a powerful rhinoceros that can charge into enemies and break open secret doors, Expresso, an ostrich which enables the Kongs to jump high and glide through the air, and Winky, a frog that can leap higher than any animal. The player can use each animal for the entirety of a level unless they are hit by an enemy.[5][3][6]

Donkey Kong Country 2|Super Donkey Kong 2 JP,Yes,2004,Rare,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","Some time after Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong is relaxing on the beach, until he is ambushed by the Kremlings. He gets kidnapped and brought to Kaptain K. Rool, King K. Rool's moniker in this game, who then demands the Banana Hoard he unsuccessfully tried to steal in the previous game for a ransom from the Kongs. Instead of complying, Diddy Kong and his friend Dixie resolve to go to the Kremling's home island, Crocodile Isle, to rescue Donkey Kong. Together, they travel through Crocodile Isle and are helped on their way by an assortment of animals to defeat Kaptain K. Rool.[10] Diddy and Dixie eventually battle and defeat K. Rool, releasing Donkey Kong in the process. K. Rool manages to escape though, and shortly after, Diddy and Dixie confront him in the Lost World, a secret area powered by a geyser at the heart of Crocodile Isle. They once again defeat K. Rool, who is hurled into the geyser, causing it to clog up and explode. The explosion causes all of Crocodile Isle to sink, as the Kongs watch K. Rool escape on a small sailboat.[18]
","Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest is a 2D side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls either Diddy Kong or his childhood friend Dixie Kong through 52[citation needed] varying levels over eight different worlds. The main objective of the game is to rescue Donkey Kong from King K. Rool. The game features a wide number of enemies, which include land-based reptilian Kremlings, rats, porcupines, bees, and vultures. Enemies in underwater sections include pufferfish, stingrays and piranhas. Each world culminates with a boss fight, which is required to be defeated in order to progress to the next world. Similar to its predecessor, the player-characters may neutralise most hostiles by jumping on their heads, cartwheeling through them, or throwing a barrel at them. When hit by an enemy, the active character leaves the screen, thus control will switch to the other character. The player can reclaim their partner from marked DK barrels throughout the game. If both characters die, the player will lose a life and will restart from either the beginning of the level or from the last checkpoint, which comes in the form of a star-painted barrel. If the player loses all of their lives, the game will end.[7][8]
Diddy and Dixie have unique attributes; Diddy is more agile and will run faster, whereas Dixie has a higher jump and can spin her hair in order to glide.[8] The player can pick up the other character and throw them in any direction, similar to barrels. The game also features ""animal friends"", which returns from its predecessor. Playable animals include Squitter the spider, Rambi the rhino, Rattly the rattlesnake, Enguarde the swordfish and Squawks the parrot.[9][10] These animals have unique abilities which the player can utilise, such as Rambi's ability to charge at enemies, Squawks' ability of flight,[10] and Rattly's ability to jump extreme heights.[8]
The game features environmental effects throughout some levels, which include fog, rain, and thunderstorms. Some levels feature different mechanics and settings, such as underwater sections, riding a mine cart, grappling onto vines, and ""honey"" levels which feature sticky surfaces.[7][8] As with its predecessor, the game features barrels that will propel the player in any direction they are facing.[11] Aside from checkpoint barrels, some give the player temporary invincibility or an ""animal friend"". Bonus barrels hidden throughout the game transport the player to a bonus game, which features a challenge such as eliminating all enemies in order to earn a ""Kremcoin"".[10] In addition, there are some barrels that can only be activated by a specific character.[8][10] Players may earn extra lives by collecting balloons, earning 100 bananas or collecting four letters which spell ""KONG"".[7][11]
The player can achieve a maximum completion score of 102% for their save file by completing all levels and bosses, completing all bonus challenges, collecting all DK coins within the Lost World and visiting each of the four Kong family members at least once.[12]

The game is Dixie Kong's first appearance in the Donkey Kong franchise.[13] Other characters include Cranky Kong, situated in ""Monkey Museum"", who is back due to ""popular demand"" to divulge secrets of the game world and provide comic relief, as well as offer advice.[14] Wrinkly Kong, the wife of Cranky Kong and grandmother of Donkey Kong, makes her first appearance in this game. She runs an educational facility called ""Kong Kollege"", where she gives guidance to the player.[15] Swanky Kong runs a gameshow quiz where the player may complete quizzes and earn extra lives.[16] Funky Kong offers an aeroplane that allows the players to switch between already completed worlds. Additionally, the player can meet a large Kremling called ""Klubba"",[10] at ""Klubba's Kiosk"", who demands fifteen Kremkoins from the characters if they want to pass onto the ""Lost World"" and complete a secret level.[17]"
Donkey Kong Country 3|Super Donkey Kong 3 JP,Yes,2005,Rare,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","The player-characters in this game are Dixie Kong, who is Diddy Kong's girlfriend, and her younger cousin, Kiddy Kong.[18] Scattered around the overworld are various other characters: Wrinkly Kong appears in ""save caves"", which when entered allow the player to save their game; Funky Kong plays a key role in the game, as he supplies the player with vehicles to traverse the overworld; Swanky Kong, reappearing from the previous game, allows players to challenge Cranky Kong in a contest involving throwing balls at targets in exchange for Bear Coins.[17] New to the series are the Brothers Bear, thirteen bears providing the player with services in exchange for Bear Coins, some of who are instrumental for advancing through the game.[15] The main antagonist of the previous games, King K. Rool, reappears under the moniker of ""Baron K. Roolenstein"".[19]
Shortly after the events of Diddy's Kong Quest, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong suddenly disappear in the Northern Kremisphere.[11] Dixie Kong sets off to find the pair and is joined by her cousin Kiddy Kong and aided by Funky Kong's vehicles to traverse the land. They reach Kastle KAOS, the lair of a robot named KAOS, who was thought to be the new leader of the Kremlings. After they destroy KAOS, the curtain in the background rolls up to reveal the robot was being controlled by Baron K. Roolenstein, the new moniker of King K. Rool. After the duo fights him, Donkey and Diddy pop out of the destroyed KAOS, implying they were being used to power the robot.
Dixie and Kiddy uncover the extinct volcanic island of Krematoa. They meet Boomer, an exiled member of the Brothers Bear, inside his Anderson shelter. He agrees to destroy the rocks hindering the path in exchange for bonus coins. After Dixie and Kiddy find all bonus coins and five cogwheels hidden in Krematoa, the duo give the cogs to Boomer, who puts them into a machine which reactivates Krematoa, revealing the Knautilus, K. Roolenstein's personal submarine. The Kongs board the submarine and battle against him in there; however, he escapes once again.
Once the Kongs collect all DK coins, they give the coins to Funky, who in exchange gives them a gyrocopter. The duo then finds an enigmatic creature called the Banana Bird Queen, who is bound to a barrier cast by K. Roolenstein. She tells the Kongs that she can only be freed if her separated children are returned to her, and that she will rid the land of K. Rool if she is freed. The Kongs find each of her children in a cave, where one of the birds is trapped in a crystal which shatters when the Kongs complete a Simon-like memory game. After rescuing them and completing a large trade sequence between the Brothers Bear, the Kongs return the children to the Queen. The Queen and her children all sing, annihilating the barrier. The Queen proceeds to chase K. Rool, who is fleeing in a hovercraft. When she catches up to him, she drops a giant eggshell on top of him, which Dixie and Kiddy land on. The Kongs repeatedly knock on the shell, annoying K. Rool.
","Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! is a platform game where players control Dixie Kong and her baby cousin, Kiddy Kong, through 8 worlds which comprise a total of 48 levels.[3][4] Many of the gameplay elements from previous games in the series mark a return in this game, such as barrels,[5] bonus levels which reward the player with special ""bonus coins"", DK coins, animal helpers and a multiplayer mode.[6] Both of the two playable Kongs have unique abilities, such as Dixie's ability to slow her descent by spinning her ponytail,[7] and Kiddy's ability to bounce across open water.[8][9] The Kongs may also pick each other up to throw each other around levels; the impact of the other player-character can reveal cracked floors, hidden switches or secret areas. At any time, the player can switch Kongs during a level.[10]
Levels in the game include a mixture of platforming, swimming and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles.[11] Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel[12] over them so it bounces off a wall behind them in order to strike them from behind.[6] The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.[11][13]
The game features ""animal friends"", which return from its predecessors. Returning animals include Enguarde the swordfish, Squitter the spider and Squawks the parrot.[14] New animals include Ellie the elephant, who can suck up water through her trunk to spray enemies with, and Parry the ""parallel bird"", who flies directly above the player-characters and can be used to collect out-of-reach items.[9] As in the previous game, players can directly control animals instead of just riding them.[14] Scattered around the Northern Kremisphere overworld are the Brothers Bear, a family of bears who provide the players with hints, key items or other services.[15] Players can collect items in levels to trade with the bears for other items or to help progress to later levels;[16] one such item is the Bear Coin, which acts as the game's currency.[6] Other members from the Kong family, such as Wrinkly Kong, Swanky Kong, and Funky Kong, can also be found around the overworld, each of whom offer their own services.[17]

Doom,Yes,2001,David A. Palmer Productions,Activision,"NA, PAL",NaN,NaN
Doom II: Hell on Earth,Yes,2002,Torus Games,Activision,"NA, PAL","The continuous 30 levels are divided into three episode-like sections, defined by their corresponding sky texture; UAC Underground/Outpost, City, and Hell.
Immediately following the events in Doom, the player once again assumes the role of Doomguy. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, the marine finds a portal to Earth opened by demons. After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.[10][11]
The humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive spaceships which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.[10] The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.[12]
Just as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in orbit, who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell.
After fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest demon he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin (Baphomet). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed. The marine wonders where evil people will go when they die now that Hell has been destroyed, and reflects that rebuilding the world will be more fun than saving it as he begins his journey back home.
","Doom II was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, Doom II's levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are nonlinear players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original.
Rather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first Doom, gameplay takes place over 32 levels (two of which are secret levels that can be accessed from level 15), albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as in the original episodes of Doom), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of Doom available in The Ultimate Doom, the retail re-release of the original Doom). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode.
Doom II doubled the number of non-boss monster types and started using bosses from the original Doom as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the super shotgun (a very powerful double-barreled shotgun), and a new power-up, the megasphere.
Doom's multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in Doom II, including ""out of the box"" support for a vastly increased number of dial-up modems. The two-player dial-up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player's computer in order to play either cooperatively or in deathmatch-style combat. There was also Local area network (LAN) functionality added, which was improved upon as patches and updates were released. This functionality was later incorporated into the original Doom. As with the original Doom, multiplayer games used to be played using the dial-up or LAN by the internal setup program (setup.exe), through the online service DWANGO or with once-popular programs like Kali and Kahn (using SPX) in Windows 95. Nowadays, in the modern standards, Doom II can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third-party source ports such as Odamex,[6] Zandronum,[7]
ZDaemon,[8] and are still popular today.[9] The Xbox Live Arcade port of Doom II supports online multiplayer via Xbox Live.

Double Dragon Advance can be played alone or with another player via a Game Link Cable. A third game mode allows a single player to play the game as both Lee brothers, with one character being controlled by the player while the other stands idle until the player switches character. There is also a Survival Mode in which the player must defeat as many adversaries possible in a single life.
All of the player's techniques from the original arcade game are featured, as well as several new ones based on later arcade and console versions (such as the Hyper Uppercut and the Hyper Knee from the NES version of The Revenge), as well as other beat-'em-ups by Technos such as Renegade and The Combatribes (like the sit-on-punch and the jump stomp respectively). New weapons are also added as well, including nunchakus and double kali sticks.
Four new stages were added as well, all taking place between the original stages from the arcade version. These include a Chinatown stage, a fight atop a moving truck (both inspired by Super Double Dragon), a cavern stage (similar to the one from the first NES game), and a fortress before the final stage. Most of the enemy characters from the first two arcade games are featured, along with a few new ones introduced in this version such as the Twin Tigers Hong and Huang, Kikucho, and the Five Emperors led by Raymond (a group of rival martial artists modeled after the final boss from the NES version of Double Dragon II). Moves that could not be performed on certain enemies in the original arcade games can now be performed against them in this version such as the hair-pull on the big characters in Abobo, and Burnov.

Dr. Mario & Puzzle League|Dr. Mario & Panel de Pon JP,Yes,2005,TOSE,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Dr. Mario is a falling block tile-matching video game[8] in which Mario assumes the role of a doctor, tossing two-colored medical capsules into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors â red, yellow, and blue â which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris,[9] the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls one unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are not supported by a virus or capsule will fall to the bottom of the playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.[10]
Players are first brought to the options screen, where the starting level, game speed, and music can be chosen. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three-game speed options change how fast the capsules fall within the bottle. The player's score is based on the elimination of viruses and the chosen game speed, with bonus points for clearing more than 1 in a single line. After level 20 play can be extended to accumulate points, but the number of viruses to clear remains the same.[10]
Dr. Mario offers a multiplayer gaming mode in which two players compete against each other in separate playing fields. In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.[10]

Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury,,2004,Webfoot,Atari,,"The game covers the story of Dragon Ball Z up until the destruction of the planet Namek, where Goku is the only playable character. Goku travels through different stages, including several locations of the earth and planet Namek, and gains experience not only by defeating enemies, but also by completing simple missions. In the final stage, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan in order to defeat Frieza, this being the first introduction to character transformations in the series, which will later be very common in the following games. It is also one of the first GBA games to feature full-motion video, predating the Game Boy Advance Video.
Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II was released in North America by Infogrames on 17th June, 2003. The plot of the game picks up where The Legacy of Goku left off, and continues until the end of the Cell Games Saga, when Gohan defeats the evil android Cell (between episodes 118 and 194).
The game introduced several new concepts to the series. The first was transformations, which allowed characters to become temporarily stronger, at the cost of slowly draining their energy bar. It also introduced the scouter, which allowed players to look up the stats of other characters in the game, as well as basic information about them. The game also introduced charged melee attacks, which allowed characters to unleash a powerful physical strike after a short charging period. The game also allowed characters to further supplement their stats with capsules that were scattered around the game world.
Despite being titled ""The Legacy of Goku"", this game featured the most limited play as Goku, with players starting play as Gohan and gradually unlocking Piccolo, Vegeta, Trunks, and finally, Goku, as playable characters. Once the story is completed, players can no longer play as Goku, but will be able to continue playing as the others to unlock a final playable character, Mister Satan/Hercule, in order to unlock an alternate ending to the game. The game's music is based on Bruce Faulconer's score for the FUNimation English dub of Dragon Ball Z.
Due to the game's success, a second version was released titled Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II International, exclusive to Japan on 23rd July, 2004. In this version, all characters were given new profile images and their names were reverted to their original Japanese ones. However, Mister Satan still retains his English name ""Hercule"" on the front of his parade float.
Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury is the third and final game in the series. It was released on 14th September, 2004 in North America. The game focuses on the final parts of the Dragon Ball Z series (season 7), namely the battles with Majin Buu; the first chapter takes place during episode 195 to episode 199, whilst the rest of the game takes place during episode 200 (after a seven-year flash-forward) and the following episodes.
The game added several new additions to the series. First, the game added equipment, which could be equipped to characters to alter their stats and provide various other benefits. The game also allowed players to allocate their own stat points, of which three were given per level. Also added was the ability to block by holding the 'R' button, and also to energy block by holding the 'B' button while blocking. Using the energy block slowly drains the user's energy gauge. Both techniques greatly decrease the amount of damage that is received from attacks.
The game also added various other features, such as fusions and the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 3. Although many features were added, the ability to use charge attacks by holding and releasing the 'A' button was eliminated. Players are able to play as Goku, Gohan, Goten, Vegeta and Kid Trunks in the game, with players able to unlock fusions with Gotenks and Gogeta. Like Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II, the game's music is also based on Bruce Faulconer's score for the FUNimation English dub of Dragon Ball Z.
The dialogues used in the English edition of the game are very similar, and sometimes identical, to the ones used in the English dubbed animated series (similar to Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II).
","The games are action-adventure RPGs. The player controls a Dragon Ball character and experiences various portions of the franchise. Combat is the main focus of the game. The player can press the 'A' button to use physical strikes, while the 'B' button allows the player to unleash a variety of energy-based attacks. Energy attacks drain an energy gauge - though, in the first game, it gradually recharges when not in use. Energy attacks can be cycled through with the 'L' button, and more energy attacks are learned as the player progresses through the game. Legacy of Goku II and Buu's Fury featured transformations that made the player character temporarily stronger, using their own 'rage mode' mechanic. By defeating enemies, the player receives experience points, which allow the player character to level up and grow stronger. Legacy of Goku II and Buu's Fury also feature consumable items that would restore the player character's health or energy, as well as equipment that increases the player character's stats. Legacy of Goku II and Buu's Fury also allow the player to use a device called a scouter, which is used to look up the stats of the various characters and enemies in the games, as well as basic information about them.

All special attacks require a certain part of the super meter, which fills up while standing still and holding down buttons to charge up some energy.[6] Every fight is usually ground-based, though the players can take part in an optional Sky Battle. The one that is on the ground can either accept the challenge or wait around few seconds for the challenger to return.[7]
The game consists of two game modes: Multiplayer and One Player, where One Player consists of events like endurance, sparring, time challenge and tournament and the Multiplayer allows linking with another Game Boy Advance user.

The dragon suddenly absorbs them into another Earth known as Rikyu, where they meet Meguru, a girl who was also transported to Rikyu. There, the elder of the village reveals the intentions RI-ON, the group behind Dragon Drive, have trying to obtain the Jinryuuseki stone, which grants its welder the power to control all dragons in Rikyu.

Drill Dozer|Screw Breaker: Goushin Dorirurero JP,No,2005,Game Freak,Nintendo,"NA, JP","The player plays as Jill, known as Dori Kururi (ããªã»ããã) in the Japanese version. She is the daughter of Doug, the leader of a bandit gang known as The Red Dozers. Doug was ambushed by a rival gang known as the Skullkers. They attacked the Red Dozers to steal the powerful Red Diamond, a gift from Jill's dead mother. To retrieve it, Jill mounts the powerful vehicle, the Drill Dozer.
On the way, she also comes across four other diamonds: the Yellow Diamond, which was kept in the Art Museum and drove Carrie insane; the Blue Diamond, which was floating about Kuru Ruins and stirring things up (it brought a stone statue to life and even took control of a swarm of fish); the Green Diamond, which the unnamed police warden used to animate his massive robot, with which he battles Jill; and the Dark Diamond, which gave Croog his alien appearance and unimaginable power. At the end, the Dark Diamond shatters and Croog's alien face falls off, revealing it to be a mask. Croog's true face is unknown, as a head of long blond hair drops over his eyes and he runs off-screen, sobbing and concealing his appearance with his hands. At the game's conclusion, two of the Diamonds- the Blue and Green Diamonds- are stolen by the Magnet Sisters (both serve as a recurring boss), the Yellow Diamond is returned to the Art Museum and Jill keeps the Red Diamond. Afterwards, Jill is appointed the new boss by her father, and they drive away.
","Drill Dozer is an action platformer in which the player controls Jill and her Drill Dozer. All seventeen massive stages are flooded with enemies, obstacles, and puzzles which force Jill to use Drill Dozer's drill in a wide variety of ways. The drill is activated by simply pushing one of the shoulder buttons. The R button spins the drill forward and the L button spins it backwards.
Scattered throughout the stage are red boxes marked with yellow wrenches that contain either chips or health. Each stage also contains two red gears that upgrades the drill's gearbox to allow Jill to shift her Drill Dozer to the second and third gears. The higher the gear, the more powerful the Drill Dozer's drill is and the longer it spins.
At the end of each stage (with the exception of the secret stages), Jill must face off against an enormous boss and use her drill to exploit and damage its weak point.
In each world, there is a mini-boss and a boss. All of the bosses can be defeated by using the drill in various ways. The only boss where the drill isn't used is in the final battle with Croog. The Drill Dozer falls apart, and Jill's only method of attack (and defense at that) is her fists. This final battle is the only battle where the boss does not have a health meter, as only one successful hit is required to defeat him.
When Jill's Drill Dozer runs out of health, the player receives a game over. The player can then resume the game at the beginning of the room the Drill Dozer was destroyed in by paying the shopkeeper fifty chips.
The Red Dozers' Trailer serves as Drill Dozer's ""main menu"".  Here the player can save their progress, examine Jill's Drill Dozer's equipment, check the treasure they have accumulated, or visit shopkeeper's shop purchase energy tanks, drill bit upgrades, and maps to access chips.  The shop is available after the first area, Skullker Factory, is beaten.

Upon discovering that Dubois was captured by the cartel during his investigation, Tanner rushes to rescue him before he is executed. Following the rescue attempt, Tanner and Dubois break into a cartel boathouse to find out the location of the deal, which will take place in Istanbul, Turkey.
Shortly after, the two are captured by the cartel, and meet their employer, Charles Jericho. After revealing Tanner's identity, Jericho proceeds to use his gun to murder Dubois, intending to frame him for the crime. Tanner manages to escape, and makes contact with Vauban about where the cars are being shipped to, but releases little detail on Dubois' death. They travel to Istanbul, where Tanner tails Jericho to a meeting with the Bagman, a middleman arranging the sale of the cars to Russian criminals. Overhearing that The Gator survived his assassination, Tanner asks Jones to collect him before he is killed by Jericho's people, and The Gator offers information on the deal in exchange for his safety.
After reuniting with Jones, Tanner is accused of murder by Vauban, after he receives word of Duboisâ death. Despite the threat of an Internal Affairs investigation, Tanner and Jones go rogue to continue investigating, and focus on tracking down Lomaz. In exchange for protection, Lomaz reveals that Calita and the Bagman are set to meet soon to exchange money for the stolen cars. Tanner and Jones monitor the meeting until Calita calls it off. While Jones attempts to pursue the Bagman, he is ambushed and forced to pull back; meanwhile, Tanner chases after Calita and captures her. After bringing her to Vauban to regain his trust, Tanner convinces Calita that Jericho is too dangerous to trust. Calita reveals that the cars have already been shipped to Russia, and that Jericho will not leave the city until he is paid.
With assistance from Istanbul's police, Tanner, Jones and Vauban stake out the arranged location of the exchange between Jericho and the Bagman. When the meeting takes place, Jericho murders the Bagman for providing him only half of the agreed money and fools police by using Bad Hand as a decoy, eventually leading to his death. Upon learning that Jericho will likely leave by train, Tanner cuts him off, forcing him to disembark and flee through the streets. When Jericho is cornered in an alleyway, Tanner critically wounds him, but eventually decides to have him arrested, only for Jericho to gun him down when he turns his back on him. Both men are taken to the hospital in critical condition, leaving their fate uncertain.
","Driver 3 focuses on a mixture of open-world gameplay conducted through a third-person perspective, with it possible to change to different camera angles at any time. The game consists of primarily single-player modes of gameplay - ""Undercover"", the game's story mode; ""Take A Ride"", the game's free-roam mode, which allows players to explore one of the three cities at their own pace; and ""Driving Games"", a challenge mode consisting of three types of car-based games for players to try out, such as pursuing a fleeing criminal. As with previous installments, gameplay mostly focuses on driving around one of three settings, consisting of partial but faithful recreations of real-life cities, using a variety of vehicles based on real-life models, ranging from sedans and sportcars, to vans, trucks. Vehicles can be damaged over time, though players may freely leave their vehicle and switch to another within the current game world setting they are in at any time; the exception is vehicles that are mission critical to the game's story mode, as losing these constitutes automatic failure. A notoriety system keeps track of the player's actions - any unlawful action will raise this bar, with police pursuing the player if spotted by any, and the response to stopping them changing depending on the level of notoriety they have.
Driver 3 introduces new gameplay mechanics to existing ones including motorbikes and speedboats, swimming, a health bar, and gun combat. Alongside being arrested by the cops or failing objectives in story mode, players can also fail if they run out of health without finding first aid kits to recover it. Combat focuses on the use of guns, based on real-life models and featuring a mixture of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles and sub-machine guns, and grenade launchers, to take down enemies; all weapons have a limit on ammo except for the lead character's personal weapon, but more can be found from dealing with enemies, or around the game world setting being played in during Take A Ride.
In Undercover Mode, players conduct a series of missions in which they must complete objectives, dealing with tasks such as escaping pursuers, reaching locations, and taking down culprits. At times, the player must complete objectives within a specific condition, such as a time-limit, with failure resulting in the player having to restart the mission. In Take A Ride, players can freely explore either Miami, Nice or Istanbul, searching for secrets, which consist of special cars and a group of hostile NPCs based upon the character of Tommy Vercetti from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. If the player completes a mission of the story or leaves Take A Ride, they can freely choose to edit a replay footage from their game with different camera angles and film effects (i.e. slow-motion). The amount of footage they can edit is pre-determined and restricted in size.

Driver 2 Advance,,2002,Sennari Interactive,Infogrames,"NA, PAL","In Chicago, Pink Lenny meets with a tattooed Brazilian man at a bar. Two gangsters suddenly enter the bar and open fire on them; Lenny escapes, but the Brazilian man is killed. His body is later examined at a morgue by police officers John Tanner and Tobias Jones. The man's tattoos indicate that he worked for Alvaro Vasquez, the leader of a Brazilian criminal organization. Following this, Tanner and Jones are sent undercover to investigate Lenny's involvement in recent gang violence in Chicago.
They interrogate a witness to the bar shooting, who explains that Lenny used to work as a money launderer for Solomon Caine, a high-ranking mobster with operations based in Chicago and Las Vegas. Furthermore, it is revealed that Lenny has made a deal with Vasquez, Caine's greatest rival.  Tanner and Jones later follow one of Vasquez's men to a warehouse, where they find hardware that has been shipped from Cuba.
As both Caine and Vasquez will seek to exploit Lenny's financial expertise for their operations, Tanner and Jones search for Lenny before gang violence spirals out of control. The officers track Lenny to Havana, where Tanner disrupts Vasquez's operations, but is too late to stop Lenny from leaving the city on a ship bound for San Diego.
Tanner later apprehends Charles Jericho, one of Caine's men, before traveling to Las Vegas with Jones to negotiate a truce with Caine. Caine assigns Jones to find Lenny while Tanner uses his driving skills to assist Caine's operations in Las Vegas, eventually succeeding in destroying Vasquez's supply depot. Soon after, Caine learns that both Lenny and Vasquez are in Rio de Janeiro.
After Caine arrives in Rio, Jones notes that Vasquez did not stop Caine from entering the city, despite monitoring the docks and airport.  Tanner continues assisting Caine and disrupting Vasquez's operations. Jones manages to infiltrate Vasquez's gang to gain more information, but Tanner warns him that his cover will not last.
Tanner later learns that Vasquez has discovered Jonesâ true identity and that Lenny is attempting to leave Rio by helicopter.  After rescuing Jones, Tanner is forced by Caine to pick up Jericho before going to stop Lenny from escaping.  Tanner and Jericho shoot down the helicopter before Tanner reveals himself to Jericho and goes after Lenny alone, arresting him after his helicopter eventually crashes.
After Tanner brings Lenny back to Chicago, it is revealed that Caine and Vasquez have been affiliated previously, and they reconcile in Rio.
","Driver 2 expands on Driver's structure, as well as adding the ability of the character, Tanner, to step out of his car to explore on foot and commandeer other vehicles in the game's environments.[2] The story missions are played separately from the Take-A-Ride Mode where the player can explore the cities in their own time.
Missions in the game are generally vehicle-oriented, and involve trailing witnesses, ramming cars and escaping from gangsters or cops. A cutscene is shown prior to almost every mission to help advance the storyline, and thus the game plays rather like a Hollywood-style car chase movie. Although Tanner can leave his car and interact with certain elements of the environment, all violence takes place during pre-rendered scenes.
While the original PlayStation version offered a two-player split screenplay, the Game Boy Advance version introduced a four-player link option.[2]
Driver 2 includes four cities, which are notably larger than the original game. The cities are Chicago, Havana, Las Vegas, and Rio de Janeiro.
A wide variety of cars can be found throughout the game. They are based on real life cars like Chevys, Fords, GMC and more. All the cars can be driven and there are also hidden cars in the game's four the cities. Similar to the first game, cars' hubcaps can fly off. They fly off less than in the previous game, giving gameplay more realism.

","The games uses a stripped-down version of the 3rd edition D&D rules"" with only four basic character classes and several traits, feats and skills.[3][4] It is not a port of the original game, though it possesses roughly the same plot. It bears stronger resemblance to the original Gold Box games, such as Pool of Radiance.
Navigating through the dungeons is done in first-person mode, where the characters can make use of their skills to get through difficulties and have very limited use of spells. When an enemy is encountered, the game mode switches to an isometric topdown view, where the player does turn-based combat against monsters.[5] Killing all enemies ends the combat mode. In some places, the player can recruit up to two additional characters, gather information and buy or sell items. Using items requires the player to equip them in a menu-driven inventory system.[2]

Dynasty Warriors Advance|Shin Sangoku Musou AdvanceJP,No,2005,TOSE,Koei,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The earlier PSP game is based on Dynasty Warriors 4, but each stage is broken down into a map of smaller battles that you move around like a board game. Advance is mostly its own game, but uses a similar ""board game"" map. It is still turn-based like the PSP game, but instead of battles being timed and all armies moving at once, each force has its own turn, making Advance even more like a board game.
Advance features 13 playable characters and 11 battles from the Three Kingdoms. Characters have some similar attacks to their counterparts in the other Dynasty Warriors games, but there is no jumping, arrows, or mounts. Characters still level up and can acquire weapons hidden around the map. There is a new mechanic, a Gradius-style power meter that cycles through a number of powerups as you defeat enemies; you lose powerups as you take damage, and you start every battle with no power.
Advance has the following characters. Characters with a * must be unlocked.
Wei
Shu
Wu
""Lu""
Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian are each unlocked by completing their country's Musou Mode with any character. Lu Bu is unlocked by completing Musou Mode with Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian.
Sima Yi, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Quan appear as ally or enemy officers in the appropriate battles, but cannot be unlocked. Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, and Yuan Shao appear as ally or enemy officers in their battles, but can't be unlocked either.

Earthworm Jim,No,2001,Game Titan,Majesco Entertainment,"NA, PAL","Jim is a normal earthworm, until a special ""super suit"" falls from the sky and allows him to operate much like a human, with his worm body acting as a head and the suit acting as a body.[11] Jim's task is two-fold, he must evade the game's many antagonists, who want the suit back, and also rescue and protect Princess What's-Her-Name from them. The game plays out with Jim succeeding in his quest and rescuing Princess What's-Her-Name. However, she is crushed by a cow that Jim launched into space at the beginning of the game.[11]
","The game plays as a 2D sidescrolling platformer with elements of a run and gun game as well. The player controls Jim and must maneuver him through the level while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The player can use Jim's gun as a method of shooting enemies, or his head as a whip for whipping enemies. The whip move also allows the player to grab hold of, and swing from, certain hooks in the game. Some levels have additional requirements beyond merely getting to the end of the level. For example, the level ""For Pete's Sake"", involves making sure the computer-controlled Peter Puppy character gets through the level unharmed, which is accomplished by whipping him to make him jump over pits, and defeating enemies before they can damage him. Failure to do so results in Peter lashing out at Jim, taking away from his health.
Levels commonly culminate with a boss battle. The game incorporates a large variety of villains in the boss battles, including Psy-Crow, Queen Slug-for-a-Butt, Evil the Cat, Bob the Killer Goldfish, Major Mucus, and Professor Monkey-For-A-Head. Two villains made their only appearance in this game, Chuck, a junkyard man with a tendency to vomit bizarre objects, and Doc Duodenum, a crazed organ of a giant alien.
In-between most levels, a racing level called ""Andy Asteroids"" is played. Unlike the rest of the game, it places the viewpoint behind Jim. The player must direct Jim on his rocket, in a race against Psycrow, through a tube-like structure while collecting items and boosts and avoiding asteroids. If the player wins, the next level is started instantly. If the player loses, a boss fight against Psy-Crow must be won in order to progress to the next level.
Other variations in gameplay occur over the course of the game as well, such as a competitive bungie-jumping and fighting level, and an underwater maze that must be traversed both within a timelimit and without crashing too many times.[10]

Earthworm Jim 2,No,2002,Super Empire,Majesco Entertainment,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The purpose of the game is largely the same as it was in the original Earthworm Jim; traverse through the levels in order to save Princess What's Her Name from Psy-Crow.[11] However, gameplay is much more diverse than in the original game.
While the majority of levels are still based on run and gun and platform game elements, separate levels incorporate different gameplay elements as well.[12] Some levels, such as the opening level, ""Anything But Tangerines"", and the game's eighth level, ""Level Ate"", play largely the same as the original Earthworm Jim, with the exception of there being a larger variety of moves at the players disposal.[13] For instance, there are more types of guns to use once found in a level, such as an auto-aiming gun, or the ""Barn Blaster"" gun which takes out every enemy visible on the screen.[13] Additionally, Jim's friend, Snott, travels with him and can be used to stick and swing to other slimy green surfaces or as a parachute upon jumping.[13]
Other levels stray much farther from this formula. In the fourth level, ""The Villi People,"" the player must guide Jim, defenseless in the disguise of a blind cave salamander, through intestinal passages, while avoiding exploding sheep and hazards embedded in the floor and walls.[12] The latter part of the level suddenly switches to a game show/trivia format, where the player has to answer nonsensical multiple choice questions that commonly have no logically correct answer.[13]  Another level, aptly titled ""Inflated Head"", has Jim's head inflated much like a balloon, and the player must control Jim as he floats upward, avoiding touching sharp objects which cause him to fall back down to the start of the level, all the while dodging Evil the Cat's attacks.[14]
Yet another, ""The Flyin' King"", plays as an isometric shooter, with Jim again on his ""pocket rocket"", where a balloon with a bomb must be directed to the end of the level, and defended from enemies, in order to defeat Major Mucus.[12] The last level of the game is not a typical boss fight, but rather, a race against Psy-Crow through an obstacle course, to get to Princess What's Her Name.[13] The game ends with Jim saving the Princess, but all three characters eventually turning randomly into cows.[13]
Two bosses are exclusive to this game, Pedro Pupa, a unicycle riding pupa, and Flamin' Yawn, a fire breathing steak.

Ecks vs. Sever,,2001,Crawfish Interactive,Bam Entertainment,"NA, PAL",NaN,"At the beginning of the game, players choose which character, Ecks or Sever, they wish to control. Both characters' plots intertwine and are given different level designs for each of their missions, amounting to eleven per character, with occasional boss battles against the other character.  A password system is used to maintain player progress, with each level's password starting with the same first letter as the name of the character it is associated with.  The gameplay is similar to other early FPS titles such as Doom, in that all of the graphics for enemies and weapons are 2D sprites in a 3D setting, and the controls utilize the d-pad for tank-like movement and shoulder buttons for strafing.

"Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures",,2005,Artificial Mind and Movement,Midway Games,"NA, PAL","The game is divided into six segments, each having its own separate plot. The two bonus stages are only available in the console and Windows versions of the game.
In ""Cool Yer Ed"", the Eds plan to steal ice cubes from coolers in the neighborhood kids' backyards to create snow-cones to sell during the warm weather. Though they face obstacles, Ed's unquestioned strength and speed guides them through. They find a meatball-making machine in Rolf's shed, but Rolf refuses to let them use it. His pigs escape after Ed smashes Rolf's pig pen fence, and the Eds agree to catch the pigs if Rolf lets them borrow the machine. Rolf agrees, and the Eds capture the pigs in the pig pen. The Eds finally make snow cones by covering the meatballs in ice, which Ed begins to eat.
In ""Pin the Tail on the Ed"", Jimmy has a birthday party, but Rolf tells the Eds not to go. The Eds find their own way to the party, and Ed suggests that they sneak in through the sewers. Despite Edd's worries, Eddy leads his friends through the sewer to crash Jimmy's party and are successful. While everyone is inside Jimmy's house, the Eds break Jimmy's pinatas, but the Kankers pop out of one and chase them. Edd uses his slingshot to shoot down beehives, which makes the bees chase the Kankers away. Afterward, Kevin tells the Eds that the party has ended. Jimmy ""rewards"" them with a blob of icing with five birthday candles in it, which Ed proceeds to eat.
In ""Must Be Something I Ed"", Rolf informs the Eds of the candy store's ""Customer Appreciation Day"", in which employees give out free jawbreakers. Because closing time is nearing, Eddy takes a shortcut, which passes Sarah and Jimmy, Kevin, Johnny, and Plank, and a vicious bulldog. After arriving at the candy store, Eddy suffers an allergic reaction to a tainted jawbreaker. The trio sneaks back to Eddy's house unseen, but as Eddy draws the curtains, the kids appear and laugh while photographing Eddy's face.
In ""Ed on Arrival"", Rolf boasts about his Urban Ranger badge to the Eds, and Eddy says he wants one. Rolf challenges the Eds to cross the Peach Creek Estates construction site, where he has set up an assault course, promising them the badge if they cross it. Eddy refuses at first, but when Rolf says the badge will go to Kevin instead, Eddy accepts his challenge. Rolf privately tells Kevin to ensure the Eds do not succeed. Despite Kevin's tricks, traps, and tribulations, the Eds complete Rolf's tasks. After a head-butting competition with Rolf's goat, Victor, the Eds race Kevin for the badge. The Eds win, but for the badge to be shared fairly, Rolf rips the badge into three pieces. Ed wants to trade his piece with Eddy's, but Eddy is so annoyed that he shoves it up Ed's nose and storms off.
In ""Nightmare on Ed Street"", Jimmy's toy rabbit, Mr. Yum Yum, is trapped on the window sill of an abandoned house. When Eddy promises to retrieve it for a quarter, Jimmy refuses, saying he will pay him when he gets Mr. Yum Yum back. Inside the house, Eddy reveals that he told Ed to steal Jimmy's rabbit so Jimmy would pay to have it returned, but Ed tells Eddy that he put Mr. Yum Yum on the mantel, not the window sill. Suddenly, the Kanker sisters appear, holding Mr. Yum Yum and threatening to cut it with a spinning saw. After the Kankers make flirtatious advances towards the Eds, they agree to trade Mr. Yum Yum with the Eds in exchange for giving them ""good boyfriend presents"" without any kisses. After exploring around the abandoned house, the Eds bring the Kankers their presents (a ship in a bottle for Lee, a can of axle grease for Marie, and a taxidermy book for May) and disable the saw. They successfully retrieve Mr. Yum Yum for Jimmy, only for it to fall in half. Jimmy runs off crying, leaving the Eds without their promised reward.
In ""Ed Marks the Spot"", Eddy plans to share his secret stash of jawbreakers in his suitcase with Ed and Edd, but someone has taken them all. As Eddy shakes the suitcase, a piece of a map falls out. Edd suggests that they search for other map pieces to recover Eddy's missing jawbreakers. The Eds collaborate to discover the jawbreaker thief and confront him/her. They collect the first piece from Johnny (who tried turning it into a paper airplane), the second piece from Jimmy (who tried doing origami with it), and the last piece from Rolf's goat, Victor, by head-butting him off a cliff. After putting the pieces together, they realize the Kankers took the jawbreakers. When Eddy angrily storms into their trailer, the Eds accidentally activate a trap door and fall underground. They run away from the Kankers, who are madly trying to kiss them. They enter a room where they battle the Kankers to get the jawbreakers back. After defeating them, the Eds grab the jawbreakers and run back to the Kankers' trailer, which has been decorated to look like a church. They realize that the Kankers have trapped them in a wedding ceremony, as they kiss the frightened Eds.
In ""Revenge of Ed-zilla"", Eddy recreates his Edtropolis scam. All is well until Ed believes he is a monster and rampages throughout the city. He battles the Kankerator at the Chunky Puffs factory, using giant Chunky Puffs as his weapon against them. After Ed defeats the Kankers (destroying Edtropolis in the process), Eddy angrily whacks Ed in the face with a metal dustpan lid.
In ""Robot Rebel Ranch"", the Eds are stuck on a robot planet, and their only hope is to get to the space rocket. Ed thinks he should take the lead, but he gets zapped by robot rebels and taken capture. Edd (using Ed's laser pistol and a red lightsaber) and Eddy (using a shock bomb and yellow plasma flail) try to rescue Ed from the robot rebels. After freeing Ed, they must find the space rocket before leaving the planet. They battle the giant robot leader: a huge, red robot turret with a cowboy hat and two laser cannons. Edd helps them complete their mission and find the rocket. Their imaginary game is disrupted when Sarah yells at Ed to come home for dinner as the game ends with Ed crossly storming away.
","Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures is a 3D platforming game in which protagonists Ed, Edd, and Eddy are playable characters. Players can use them in special tag team formations like the ""(Leaning-)Tower-of-Eddy"" (as Eddy), ""Trampol-Edd"" (as Edd), and ""Batter-Ed(-Ram)"" (as Ed) to complete eight levels, referred to as scams. The Eds' normal weapons and skills include Ed lifting heavy objects and smashing his head, Edd using a slingshot to hit distant targets and smacking with his ruler in close range, and Eddy using the El Mongo stink bomb to stun enemies,[2] along with using his wallet attached to a chain like a yo-yo.

However, the stone is actually a dragon egg. Eragon names the dragon Saphira from the list of dragon names he heard from the storyteller Brom. Saphira's hatching attracts the attention of the cruel king Galbatorix. The king dispatches servants to Eragon's village to find the dragon. They are unsuccessful and Eragon's uncle is killed and his home burned down. Brom, whom Eragon considers as nothing more than an old storyteller, helps him fight his way out of the village. He then gives Eragon an old sword, known as Zar'roc in the book series.
Eragon and Saphira make their way to Daret, where they are attacked in the docks. They find the rest of the town on fire and hold off a swarm of the king's servants as the villagers try to put out these fires. After leaving Daret the three are pursued by a group of Ra'zac. The group are caught in an ambush: Saphira becomes trapped under debris and Eragon must both try to free her and hold off the Ra'zac. After defeating the nearby enemies, the group make their way to Gil'ead, where Eragon and Brom sneak through the city and keep to try and free Arya. After a lengthy battle through Durza's fortress, Eragon meets Arya and Murtagh, who now join the group. This helps alleviate the mournful situation when Brom jumps in the way of a spear intended to kill Eragon and is fatally injured and dies.
The group escape from Gil'ead on Saphira's back, but face some Kull in the ruins of Orthiad. After defeating many Kull and Urgals they make their way to the Beor Mountains, where more Urgals lie in wait. They then sneak through an Urgal encampment, and make their way through a misty gorge. The group get to the Varden's hideout and defend it against hordes of Urgals. Eragon and Saphira then face Durza a second time, mounted on the back of a huge, batlike monster, eventually killing him.[9]
","The majority of the game is taken up by third-person combat, usually on foot. At the start of the game the player can use four ""combo"" attacks. Additionally, they can use three basic magic attacks: magic push/pull (Thrysta Vindr), magic shield (SkÃ¶lir), and magic fire (Brisingr). These three magic attacks can be utilised in different ways (for example, Brisingr arrows, or throwing spears in baskets magically). On the PC and console versions (excluding the Xbox 360 version) there are sixteen levels.[7]
Some missions permit the player to use the dragon Saphira in combat. The gameplay mechanics within these levels are largely similar to those in ground-based levels, with the exception of some different attack moves (such as tail attacks). Protagonist Eragon sits on Saphira's back during these sections, and can be made to fire magic arrows. The player has no choice as to whether or not they use Saphira. Similarly, the player cannot use Saphira in ground-based levels: they can call for her and she will swoop past, but it is not possible to use this feature to ride Saphira. There is a multiplayer co-op mode which allows two people to play through the main storyline. It is possible to switch from playing a one-player game to a two-player game at any time. There are no Internet multiplayer options.[8]

In X Games, players attempt to earn the highest score within a one-minute time limit. One of the playable levels is inspired by the halfpipe used in X Games Six.[4] The game also has an arcade mode, where players roam levels and complete various goals, and collecting spinning X Games logos, which unlocks other playable levels.[5]
In the Game Boy Advance version, players increase their attributes via the X-Rage meter, where players fill up the meter by performing tricks, which later will cause a coin to appear on the halfpipe. After the player grabs the coin, they're flown higher into the air, and players are to perform a 10-trick combo. If the player successfully accomplishes this, gems will fall down onto the halfpipe, which players can collect. If players grab enough gems of a particular color, the skater the player is playing as will have his attributes raised in a specific section.[6]

Eyeshield 21: Devilbats Devildays,,2006,Eighting,Nintendo,JP,"In Tokyo,[note 1] a weak, unassertive boy named Sena Kobayakawa enters the high school of his choiceâDeimon Private Senior High School. Sena's only remarkable physical abilities are his running speed and agility, which are noted by the school's American football team captain Yoichi Hiruma. Hiruma forces Sena to join the Deimon Devil Bats football team as its running back. To protect his identity from other teams who want to recruit him, Sena is forced to publicly assume the role of the team secretary and enter the field under the pseudonym of ""Eyeshield 21"" wearing a helmet with an eyeshield to hide his features. The makeshift team initially takes part in the spring football tournament hoping to win through the strength of their new ""secret weapon"". However, the extremely weak team is eliminated early by the Ojo White Knights, one of the best football teams in Japan.
After Deimon's defeat, the spring tournament is revealed as secondary in importance to the fall tournament, where the teams compete for the chance to play in the Christmas Bowlâthe high school football league championship. Hiruma, Ryokan Kurita, and Sena regroup and slowly build a real team from misfits and students looking to define themselves, such as TarÅ ""Monta"" Raimonâa baseball player who can only catchâand the Ha-Ha Brothers. Other characters slowly join the team, and the series follows the building and growth of the Deimon Devil Bats and its members, and rival teams as they all strive to achieve their goal of playing in the Christmas Bowl.
Some time after the Deimon Devil Bats win the Christmas Bowl and they become the best team in the country, Japan begins to gather the best football players to form a team to represent it at the American Football Youth World Championship, where a Most Valuable Player (MVP) will be awarded an NFL contract and $3 million. Team Japan reaches the final against Team America, in which the game ends as a tie, and both teams are declared winners. Both teams are unsatisfied with this and return to the field for their own, improvised ""overtime"", causing chaos with officials. It is unclear which team wins the unofficial extra period, but Panther of Team America holds the MVP trophy aloft, winning the professional contract with the San Antonio Armadillos.
The series concludes with Sena becoming the captain of the Devil Bats after Hiruma and Kurita leave school to attend college. In his final year of high school, Sena is invited to Notre Dame High School. In the final chapter, the main characters are in college or playing amateur-league football while employed.

The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' Da Rules,,2003,Blitz Games,THQ,,"Timmy Turner's mother and father have gone on a vacation and left Timmy with the evil babysitter Vicky. When Timmy tries to make a wish, his fairy godparents Cosmo and Wanda tell him that it's against ""Da Rules"". Outraged, Timmy wishes he didn't have to follow the rules. As a result, Cosmo destroys the book; when Vicky arrives, she gains possession of Da Rules. She wishes that Timmy was still sleeping, and since she has possession of a fairy item, her wish is granted. Timmy, Cosmo, and Wanda go to Fairy Court and are accused of destroying Da Rules. Jorgen gives the three of them 49Â½ hours to find the missing pages of Da Rules. Timmy must navigate through ten levels and find the pages before Vicky's wishing goes too far. By the end of the game, everything is back to normal and Da Rules has all of its pages back.
The PC version features a different plot. In this version, Juandissimo Magnifico tricks Timmy into wishing the book destroyed so that Cosmo and Wanda will get in trouble for it. It also notably features an appearance by Vicky and Tootie's mother (at Timmy's age, as the level featuring her is set in the past), named Nicky. Here, she is shown behaving a lot like Tootie, and Timmy initially mistakes her for Tootie when he first sees her, although the in-game graphics depict her as resembling a young Vicky.
In the Game Boy Advance version, Anti-Cosmo arrives to steal the book, and Vicky is defeated at the very end to restore peace.

The Fairly OddParents: Shadow Showdown,,2004,Blitz Games,THQ,"NA, PAL","The game starts with young Timmy Turner being excited to see a new special season finale episode of one of his favorite shows--Crash Nebulaâon TV. However, he finds that his TV stops working just as it premieres, and the only other time it can be seen is a day later when it reruns. He attempts to have Cosmo and Wanda fix it through a wish, but they can't, since their wands aren't working.
The reason for this is that the Royal Jewel, the second most powerful source of fairy magic in existence, has been stolen, meaning that wish-granting powers have been disabled on a massive scale. Timmy goes on a mission to try to find out who stole the Jewel and turn him in, so that all will be returned to normal.  The first suspect is Quince, the royal jester in service of Oberon and Titania, rulers of Fairy World, who was recently fired for ""not being funny.""
After fighting Quince, Timmy has him interrogated by Jorgen von Strangle, but it turns out that Quince did not have the Jewel, and the only way to get it back was by using the magic of the first-most-powerful source of magic: the famous Fairyversary Muffin (first introduced in the Fairly OddParents TV-Movie ""Abra-Catastrophe!"").
To assemble the muffin, Timmy must bake it with magical forms of common cake ingredients, namely super strong hair raising flour, a phoenix egg, pixie sugar, and mooncalf milk. He somehow orders everything using the Internet, but Vicky snatches everything, and the ingredients are scattered in various places, such as in the possession of his parents or of Vicky herself (although the Phoenix Egg was destroyed).  With the ingredients compromised, the trio must work to recover everything and put together the muffin before it's too late.

F-Zero: Climax,Yes (SPM),2004,Suzak,Nintendo,JP,NaN,"F-Zero Climax is a racing game that plays similarly to its immediate predecessor (F-Zero: GP Legend) and the original F-Zero game.[3] Players select their vehicles[4] and race around fifty-three courses[5] while avoiding obstacles such as ice and bombs.[4] Each racing craft contains air brakes for drifting around tight corners by pressing the L and R shoulder buttons.[6] A vehicle's health and ability to speed boost after the first lap is measured by an energy meter. Boosting in this manner briefly increases the racer's speed while draining their energy. The player is also rewarded with a stored speed boost for each lap completed. However, this may only be used in tandem with the energy-draining boost resulting in a double speed boost.[4] Vehicles can drive over pink plates scattered throughout the track to replenish energy.[6] Players can damage competitors with two attacks: a spin attack that quickly rotates the entire vehicle, or a side attack. The former is new to the 2D F-Zero series. Players can also spin attack during a speed boost to inflict extra damage. The game offers four control scheme presets, and personalized button configurations.[4]
Climax has numerous gameplay modes and options, some of which were carried over from F-Zero: GP Legend.[4] In the Grand Prix mode, the player races against twenty-three opponents[7] through three laps of each track in a cup.[4] Each of the four cups available (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum)[8] has multiple difficulty levels. Track selection per cup may vary based on difficulty level chosen.[5] Time attack let players choose any track to complete it in the shortest time possible. Zero Test is a selectable option in Time Attack where players may complete in thirty-six time trials on a small section of track. Survival consists of mission-based objectives such as navigating courses with depleted health, and racing an opponent on a short guardrail-less track without flying off-course at the finish line by braking. Completing a series of survival challenges unlocks a character biography with a brief episode summary from the TV Tokyo anime series F-Zero: GP Legend.[4] The multiplayer mode is where two to four players can compete simultaneously.[7]
Edit mode allows the creation of tracks. Players can lay track pieces that come in an assortment of sizes and shapes. Each piece has a list of obstacles available. Track pieces are valued at varying points, for example, larger pieces are worth more points. A track may have up to 255 points.[4] Players can participate in races on them, or setup camera angles to spectate artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled racers. Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and shared with other players via Game Link Cable. The game can also generate a track-specific password that can be inputted on any Climax cartridge for conversion back to the custom track.[7]

F-Zero: GP Legend|F-Zero: Falcon DensetsuJP,Yes (SPM),2003,Suzak,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The game plays similar to the original Super NES version of F-Zero and uses features from  F-Zero X on the Nintendo 64. The game uses a new Mode 7 effect designed for the Game Boy Advance to allow the background layers to rotate and scale to display the course.
The boost system is similar to F-Zero X, where the player can use a boost to gain an additional burst of speed (only available from lap 2 of each race). However, this does consumes some of the machine's energy. The machine's energy can be replenished by entering pit areas that can be found on the race course.
In addition to the boost system, the machines can trigger side attacks, similar to F-Zero GX on the Nintendo GameCube. This allows the player to take sharp corners without losing too much speed, or to attack and do damage to other machines without damaging their own machine.
The game features 34 playable characters, 8 of them are available in Story mode, including newcomer Rick Wheeler (Ryu Suzaku in the Japanese version), the evil Black Shadow, and series hero Captain Falcon. As in earlier games, a story-driven campaign leads players through a series of futuristic races across the diverse environments of many different planets.
Nintendo was planning to include Expert versions of the Platinum Cup courses. These are stored in the game but can only be accessed by using cheat codes. Mute City II is based on the F-Zero course Mute City III where the course now has mines at one point and a narrower path near the end. The other courses however are exactly the same, besides the course title having II / III on the end.
The Championship is unlocked once all the Grand Prix courses have been unlocked. This course is only available to play in Time Attack mode.

F-Zero: Maximum Velocity|F-ZeroJP,Yes (SPM),2001,NDcube,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Every race consists of five laps around a race track. Players lose the race if their machine explodes due to taking too much damage, or if they land outside of the track, get ejected from the race due to falling to 20th place, complete a lap with a rank outside of the rank limit of that lap, or forfeit. In the single player Grand Prix mode, all of these conditions require the player to possess and use an extra machine to try again.
For each lap completed the player is rewarded with a speed boost, to be used once any time; one of the ""SSS"" marks will be shaded green to indicate that it can be used. A boost will dramatically increase a player's speed, but will decrease their ability to turn. A boost used before a jump will make the player jump farther, which could allow the player to use a shortcut with the right vehicle. Boost time and speed varies according to the machine, and is usually tuned for proper balance. For example, one machine boasts a boost time of twelve seconds, yet has the slowest boost speed of the entire game. Players can also take advantage of the varying deceleration of each vehicle. Some vehicles, such as the Jet Vermilion, take longer than others to decelerate from top boost speed to normal speed, once the boost has been used up. Players can also take advantage of this effect on boost pads.
The Grand Prix is the main single player component of Maximum Velocity. It consists of four series named after chess pieces: ""Pawn"", ""Knight"", ""Bishop"" and ""Queen"".  The latter of these can be unlocked by winning the others on ""Expert"" mode. They have five races in four difficulty settings, ""Master"" mode is unlocked by winning expert mode in each series, the player unlocks a new machine after completing it. The player needs to be in the top three at the end of the last lap in order to continue to the next race. If the player is unable to continue, the player will lose a machine and can try the race again. If the player runs out of machines, then the game ends, and the player has to start the series from the beginning.
Championship is another single player component. It is basically the same as a ""Time Attack"" mode, except the player can only race on one, special course: the Synobazz Championship Circuit. This special course is not selectable in any other modes.
Maximum Velocity can be played in two multiplayer modes using the Game Boy Advance link cable, with one cartridge, or one cartridge per player. Two to four players can play in both modes.
In single cart, only one player needs to have a cartridge. The other players will boot off the link cable network from the player with the cart using the GBA's netboot capability. All players drive a generic craft, and the game can only be played on one level, Silence. Silence, along with Fire Field, are the only areas to return from previous games. Aptly, Silence in Maximum Velocity has no background music, unlike in most other F-Zero games.
In multi cart, each player needs to have a cartridge to play. This has many advantages over single cart: All players can use any machine in this game that has been unlocked by another player. Players can select any course in this game. After the race is finished, all of the players' ranking data are mixed and shared (""Mixed ranking"" stored in each cart).

Fantastic Four,,2005,7 Studios,Activision,,"The game begins with Reed, Sue, and Johnny on a roof lying helpless after being knocked unconscious by a blast from Doctor Doom.  Sue is the first to recover, so when she sits up and turns around, Dr. Doom is preparing to fire an electric blast at them. Sue holds it off with her force field and calls Ben Grimm for help. Then it cuts away to Ben, who is recovering in the transformation chamber after having his rocklike exterior genetically removed from him.  As he contemplates why the circumstances have led to this, he remembers the period when all of this happens.
This is when it reverts to the beginning of the movie: Reed signs the pact, they go into space, and Ben gets the samples ready.  In space, they are hit by a cosmic storm which alters their DNA and gives them superpowers. If it hadn't been for Victor, they might never have arrived back to Earth and into his medical compound, where they recovered.  When Ben discovers that he has become a monster-like figure, he deserts the other three and heads home.
Ben runs on a rampage to try to calm himself. This brings the army to New York under the control of a deep, dark, sinister figure who is yet to be revealed and they try to get Ben under control.  However, after Ben and the other three rescue a fire truck from falling off the Brooklyn Bridge, the forces lay off and watch the Fantastic Four to see if they become hostile.
Reed attempts to find another power source, but is interrupted by a call for help.  It seems that strange creatures have invaded Grand Central Station and the police seem to have no effect against them.  The Fantastic Four stop the creatures from invading the city and face their leader, the Mole Man and his mighty pet.  Because of the utter destruction caused by their fight with this giant monster, the city is in a mess and Victor blames Reed for all this mess.
With Ben in hand, Reed sets out to identify their mutation and possibly cure them of it.  He constructs a machine with Victor's help which will use cosmic rays to reverse the signal being sent through their bodies by the mutation.  He then turns to sources to power this machine and identifies a cosmic meteor that landed in the jungle of southern Mexico. They travel to Tikal to retrieve this meteor when they encounter Diablo, who desires to have this meteor so he can harness its power to conquer the world. The Fantastic Four defeat him and bring the meteor back, but its power is insufficient to power the machine. Later, Victor invites Sue to the opening of his Egyptian wing in the museum that night.
While they are there, Alicia Masters is kidnapped by the mummy creatures who have come to life by the Puppet Master, which throws Ben into an outrage.  Reed intends to disable the security system to free her, but they have to deal with animated mummies and dinosaurs. They free Alicia but end up destroying half the museum while repelling the reanimated creatures, which infuriates Victor to no end.
In his last attempt to alleviate his anger towards them, he has a conversation with Sue in which he attempts to find out why she continues to stay with Reed. She says she can't abandon them because they're her family now, which prompts Victor to send Doombots after them to destroy them after they finish their meeting. The four have a massive battle in Times Square, which they nearly demolish with the help of the VDI Mechs, prompting Nick Fury, to take them to the Vault prison for their safe keeping.
They arrive there and are quarantined until Dragon Man decides to break out and cause utter chaos. The Fantastic Four's security systems are deactivated and they try to restore order.  They are successful in their mission so when they reach the entrance at the top of the prison, they encounter Fury who agrees to release them on one condition: that they find out what happened to his laboratory.
When they arrive, they discover it has been taken over by mutated plants and insectoid creatures and they must destroy the station after obtaining the power source they need to finish powering Reed's transformation chamber.  This proves to be successful and the machine is powered up to its maximum.
With this knowledge, Victor travels to the Baxter Building with the intent to defeat the Fantastic Four.  He sets Reed's security systems against them and lures Ben to the transformation chamber where he steals his power.  The remaining three fight against an enhanced Dr. Doom but his power is too great and they are defeated.  Ben, however, feels terrible for leaving his friends just because he wanted to look normal again, so he decides to re-enter the transformation chamber and turn back into the Thing. Dr. Doom is about to destroy them when Ben busts out onto the roof and savagely attacks him, allowing his teammates to recover. They fall to the street and the other three join them there to finish Doom once and for all.
","The Fantastic Four is an internationally renowned group of superhuman champions.  Each of the characters has a special ability:[1]
The game includes a number of villains and characters not featured in the movie, many of whom are based on their Ultimate Universe versions like the Yancy Street Gang, Nick Fury, Mole Man, Diablo, Puppet Master, Dragon Man, Blastaar, and Annihilus.

Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls|Final Fantasy I & II Advance JP,,2004,TOSE,"Square Enix (Japan), Nintendo (overseas)","NA, PAL, JP","Final Fantasy takes place in a fantasy world with three large continents. The elemental powers of this world are determined by the state of four crystals, each governing one of the four classical elements: earth, fire, water, and wind. The world of Final Fantasy is inhabited by numerous races, including humans, elves, dwarves, mermaids, dragons, and robots. Most non-human races have only one ""town"" in the game, although individuals are sometimes found in human towns or other areas as well. Four hundred years prior to the start of the game, the Lefeinish people, who used the Power of Wind to craft airships and a giant space station (called the Floating Castle in the game), watched their country decline as the Wind crystal went dark. Two hundred years later, violent storms sank a massive shrine that served as the center of an ocean-based civilization, and the Water crystal went dark. The Earth crystal and the Fire crystal followed, plaguing the earth with raging wildfires, and devastating the agricultural town of Melmond as the plains and vegetation decayed. Some time later, the sage Lukahn tells of a prophecy that four Light Warriors will come to save the world in a time of darkness.
The game begins with the appearance of the four youthful Light Warriors, the heroes of the story, who each carry one of the darkened Orbs. Initially, the Light Warriors have access to the Kingdom of Coneria and the ruined Temple of Fiends. After the Warriors rescue Princess Sara from the evil knight Garland, the King of Coneria builds a bridge that enables the Light Warriors' passage east to the town of Pravoka. There the Light Warriors liberate the town from Bikke and his band of pirates and acquire the pirates' ship for their own use. The Warriors now embark on a chain of delivery quests on the shores of the Aldi Sea. First, they retrieve a stolen crown from the Marsh Cave for a king in a ruined castle, who turns out to be the dark elf Astos. Defeating him gains them the Crystal Eye, which they return to the blind witch Matoya in exchange for a herb needed to awaken the elf prince cursed by Astos. The elf prince gives the Light Warriors the Mystic Key, which is capable of unlocking any door. The key unlocks a storage room in Coneria Castle which holds TNT. Nerrick, one of the dwarves of the Cave of Dwarf/Dwarf Village, destroys a small isthmus using the TNT, connecting the Aldi Sea to the outside world.[5]
After visiting the near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors go to the Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and retrieve the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over.[5] With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) back in time and he sent the Fiends to the future to do so, creating a time loop by which he could live forever.[7] The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed the future to one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.[5]
","Final Fantasy has four basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a ship, a canoe, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.[4]
The game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Some town citizens offer helpful information, while others own shops that sell items or equipment. Dungeons appear in areas that include forests, caves, mountains, swamps, underwater caverns, and buildings. Dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. The game's menu screen allows the player to keep track of their experience points and levels, to choose which equipment their characters wield, and to use items and magic. A character's most basic attribute is their level, which can range from one to fifty, and is determined by the character's amount of experience. Gaining a level increases the character's attributes, such as their maximum hit points (HP), which represents a character's remaining health; a character dies when they reach zero HP. Characters gain experience points by winning battles.[4]
Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: the player selects an action from a list of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and continue until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain not only experience but also money, which is known as Gil in the Final Fantasy universe; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost.[4] Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters on the right side of the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.[5]
The player begins the game by choosing four characters to form a party and is locked into that choice for the duration of the game.[6] Each character has an ""occupation"", or character class, with different attributes and abilities that are either innate or can be acquired.[6] There are six classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, Red Mage, White Mage, and Black Mage.[6] Later in the game, the player has the option to have each character undergo a ""class upgrade""; whereby their sprite portraits mature, and some classes gain the ability to use weapons and magic that they previously could not use.[4] The game contains a variety of weapons, armor, and items that can be bought or found to make the characters more powerful in combat. Each character has eight inventory slots, with four to hold weapons and four to hold armor. Each character class has restrictions on what weapons and armor it may use. Some weapons and armor are magical; if used during combat, they will cast spells. Other magical artifacts provide protection, such as from certain spells. At shops, the characters can buy items to help themselves recover while they are traveling. Items available include potions, which heal the characters or remove ailments like poison or petrification; Tents and Cottages, which can be used on the world map to heal the player and optionally save the game; and Houses, which also recovers the party's magic after saving. Special items may be gained by doing quests.[4]
Magic is a common ability in the game, and several character classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from White and Black magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character may learn only three spells per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn any of their respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.[4]

Final Fantasy IV Advance,,2005,TOSE,"Square Enix(Japan), Nintendo (overseas)","NA, PAL, JP","Most of Final Fantasy IV takes place on Earth, also known as the Blue Planet,[20] which consists of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they believe their kind can co-exist with humans.[16] A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is never visited in the game.
Final Fantasy IV offers twelve playable characters, each with a unique, unchangeable character class. During the game, the player can have a total of five, or fewer, characters in the party at any given time. The main character, Cecil Harvey, is a dark knight and the captain of the Red Wings, an elite air force unit of the kingdom of Baron. He serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind, the commander of the Dragoons. Rosa Farrell is a white mage and archer, as well as Cecil's love interest. The Red Wings' airships were constructed by Cecil's friend, the engineer Cid Pollendina.[16]
During his quest, Cecil is joined by others, including Rydia, a young summoner from the village of Mist; Tellah, a legendary sage; Edward Chris von Muir, the prince of Damcyan who is a bard as well as the husband of Tellah's daughter Anna; Yang Fang Leiden, the head of the monks of Fabul; Palom and Porom, a black mage and a white mage, twin apprentices from the magical village of Mysidia; Edward ""Edge"" Geraldine, the ninja prince of Eblan; and Fusoya, the guardian of the Lunarians during their long sleep.
Zemus is the main antagonist of the game. He wishes to destroy the human race so that his people can populate the earth. He uses Golbez to do this by controlling him and Kain with his psychic powers to activate the Giant of Babil, a huge machine created to carry out the genocide and take over the world.
The Red Wings attack the city of Mysidia to steal their Water Crystal, and return to the Kingdom of Baron. When Cecil, Captain of the Red Wings, afterwards questions the king's motives, he is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain, his friend and Captain of the Dragoons, to deliver a ring to the Village of Mist.[21] There, Kain and Cecil watch in horror as monsters burst forth from inside the ring and lay waste to the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons a monster named Titan in anger. This monster causes an earthquake, separating Cecil and Kain.[22] Cecil awakens afterward and takes the wounded Rydia to a nearby inn. Baron soldiers come for Rydia but Cecil defends her,[23] and she joins him on his journey.
It is revealed that Rosa, Cecil's love interest, had followed him and is extremely ill with a fever. Soon after this, Cecil and Rydia meet Tellah, who is going to Damcyan Castle to retrieve his eloping daughter, Anna.[24] However, Anna is killed when the Red Wings bomb the castle. Edward, Anna's lover and the prince of Damcyan, explains that the Red Wings' new commander, Golbez, did this to steal the Fire Crystal for Baron as they had stolen the Water Crystal from Mysidia.[25] Tellah leaves the party to exact revenge on Golbez for Anna's death.[26] After finding a cure for Rosa, the party decides to go to Fabul to protect the Wind Crystal. Here they meet Master Yang, a warrior monk serviced to the kingdom and the protection of the crystal. The Red Wings attack, and Kain reappears as one of Golbez's servants. He attacks and defeats Cecil; when Rosa intervenes, Golbez kidnaps her and Kain takes the crystal.[27] On the way back to Baron, the party is attacked by Leviathan and separated.
Cecil awakes alone near Mysidia. When he enters the town, he finds that its residents deeply resent him for the prior attack on their town. Through the Elder of Mysidia, he learns that to defeat Golbez, he must climb Mt. Ordeals and become a Paladin.[28] Before embarking on his journey, he is joined by the twin mages, Palom and Porom. On the mountain he encounters Tellah, who is searching for the forbidden spell Meteor to defeat Golbez.[29] Casting aside the darkness within himself, Cecil becomes a Paladin, while Tellah learns the secret of Meteor. Upon reaching Baron, the party discovers an amnesiac Yang and restores his memory. The party then confronts the King, only to discover that he had been replaced by one of Golbez's minions, Cagnazzo.[30] After defeating him, Cid arrives and takes them to one of his airships, the Enterprise. On the way, the party enters a room booby-trapped by Cagnazzo, where Palom and Porom sacrifice themselves to save Cecil, Tellah, Cid, and Yang.
On the airship, Kain appears and demands Cecil retrieve the final crystal in exchange for Rosa's life,[31] which the party obtains with assistance from a bedridden Edward. Kain then leads the party to the Tower of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process. However, the spell only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain.[32] Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa, who teleports the party out of the collapsing tower to Baron.
In Baron, Kain reveals that Golbez must also obtain four subterranean ""Dark Crystals"" to achieve his goal of reaching the Moon.[33] The party travels to the underworld and encounter the Dwarves, who are currently fighting the Red Wings. They defeat Golbez thanks to a sudden appearance by Rydia, now a young woman due to her time spent in the Feymarch, the home of the Eidolons. However, the party ultimately fails to prevent Golbez from stealing the Dwarves' crystal. With the help of the Dwarves, they enter the Tower of Babil in order to obtain the crystals Golbez has stored there, only to find that they have been moved to a surface portion of the tower. Yang later sacrifices himself in order to stop the tower's cannons from firing on the Dwarves (though he's later revealed to have survived). After escaping a trap set by Golbez, the party flees the underworld aboard the Enterprise, with Cid sacrificing himself to reseal the passage between the two worlds and to prevent the Red Wings from continuing their pursuit (he, too, is revealed later to have survived).[34] The party, now joined by Edge, the prince of Eblan, travels back to the Tower of Babil in order to take back the stolen crystals. Upon reaching the crystal room, however, the party falls through a trap door to the underworld. Meeting with the Dwarves once again and finding Cid to be alive, the party sets out to retrieve the eighth crystal before Golbez can. When the crystal is obtained, Golbez appears and reveals he still has control over Kain, while taking the crystal for himself.[35] After learning of the Lunar Whale, a ship designed to take travelers to and from the moon, the party is rejoined by Cid. They travel to the surface and board the Lunar Whale.[36]
On the Moon, the party meets the sage Fusoya, who explains that Cecil's father was a Lunarian.[37] Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, a colossal robot.[38] The party returns to Earth and the forces of the two worlds attack the Giant, including Palom and Porom, who have been revived. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus' control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother.[39] Golbez and Fusoya head to the core of the Moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil's party follows. In the Moon's core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to his resurrected form, the spirit Zeromus, the embodiment of all of Zemus' hatred and rage.[40] Back on Earth, the Elder of Mysidia commands all of Cecil's allies and friends to pray for the party, which gives Cecil and his allies the strength to fight and slay Zeromus. Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon.[41] Cecil, at last accepting the truth, acknowledges Golbez as his brother, and bids him farewell.
During the epilogue, most of the cast reunites to celebrate Cecil and Rosa's wedding and their coronation as Baron's new king and queen, while Kain is seen atop Mount Ordeals, having vowed to atone for his misdeeds.
","In Final Fantasy IV, the player controls a large cast of characters and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a world map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination.[15] Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities.[15] The game was the first in the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.[16]
Player characters and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. Attacks reduce remaining HP until none are left, at which point the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file.[15] The player can restore the characters' hit points by having them sleep in an inn or use items in the party's inventory, such as potions, as well as using healing magic spells. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize damage received.[15] The player can choose whether characters appear on the front line of a battle or in the back. A character's placement impacts damage received and inflicted depending on the type of attack.[15]
Final Fantasy IV introduced Square's Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which differed from the turn-based designs of previous RPGs. The ATB system centers on the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles.[17] The system was used in many subsequent Square games.[16]
Each character has certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility. Like other Final Fantasy games, characters gain new, more powerful abilities with battle experience. Magic is classified as either ""White"" for healing and support; ""Black"" for offense; or ""Summon"" (or ""call"") for summoning monsters to attack or carry out specialized tasks.[15] A fourth type, ""Ninjutsu,"" consists of support and offensive magic and is available to only one character. Magic users, who account for eight of the twelve playable characters, gain magic spells at preprogrammed experience levels or fixed story events. The game includes balanced point gains, items, and rewards to eliminate long sessions of grinding.[18] Due to the Super NES' greater processing power, Final Fantasy IV contains improved graphics when compared to previous Final Fantasy titles, all of which were released on the NES. The game employs the Super NES' Mode 7 technology to give enhanced magic spell visuals and to make airship travel more dramatic by scaling and tilting the ground for a bird's eye view.[19]

Final Fantasy V Advance,,2006,TOSE,"Square Enix (Japan), Nintendo (overseas)","NA, PAL, JP","The backstory of Final Fantasy V is revealed in phases through cutscenes and interactions with non-playable characters.  One millennium before the events of the main story, a powerful mage named Enuo imperiled the world using the power of an evil entity called the ""Void"". The people retaliated by using twelve legendary weapons to vanquish Enuo; however, the Void itself could not be destroyed. Consequently, the people split the world's four elemental Crystals into two sets, effectively creating two worlds. The Void then became sealed in a dimensional cleft between the two worlds.[10]
Nearly a thousand years passed without incident, and both worlds prospered due to the powers of their Crystals of Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth. New kingdoms and towns flourished, and travel by ship acted as a critical means of commerce and communication. However, a sinister force was stirring in the second worldâever since the Void incident, malicious demons had been sealed inside a tree in the Great Forest of Moore.  The corrupted amalgamation of spirits emerged as Exdeath, the game's primary antagonist. When Exdeath attempted to claim the world for himself, a group of heroes called the ""Four Warriors of Dawn"" (Galuf, Xezat, Dorgann, and Kelger) sealed him within the first world using its Crystals, and peace returned for another thirty years.[11]
Final Fantasy V features five player characters, though only four of which are playable at a given time. Bartz Klauser is a traveling adventurer who becomes involved in the story when he investigates the site of a meteorite strike. Lenna Charlotte Tycoon is a princess of Tycoon who follows her father to investigate the Wind Shrine's Crystal. Early on, Bartz finds her unconscious and saves her from goblins. Galuf Doe is a mysterious old man who was discovered unconscious near the meteorite with a case of amnesia. Faris Scherwiz is a pirate captain who captures Bartz, Lenna, and Galuf when they try to steal her ship; she is revealed to be Sarisa Scherwill Tycoon in disguise. Krile Mayer Baldesion is the granddaughter of Galuf who journeys with him to the planet and, upon his eventual death, receives his abilities.[12]
Most of the main characters were involved with or related to the original Four Warriors of Dawn, such as Dorgann Klauser (Bartz's father), Kelger Vlondett, and Xezat Matias Surgate; Galuf was the fourth warrior. The game also contains several supporting characters, including engineer Cid Previa, his grandson Mid Previa, and turtle sage Ghido. One of Exdeath's henchmen, Gilgamesh, is a recurring mini-boss in the second half of the game. Gilgamesh has also appeared in newer Final Fantasy titles, such as Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy IX, Final Fantasy XII,[13][14] Final Fantasy XIII-2 as downloadable content, Final Fantasy IV The After Years, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, and World of Final Fantasy. Concept art for the characters was designed by Yoshitaka Amano; he has offered such artwork for every main Final Fantasy installment since the original.
Final Fantasy V begins on a day when the world's wind currents begin to slow and stale. Deeply troubled by this occurrence, the king of Tycoon makes ready to travel to the Wind Shrine on the back of his drake, quelling the worries of his daughter, Princess Lenna.  Upon arriving at the Shrine, the king bears witness to the Wind Crystal shattering before his eyes.
Meanwhile, a young traveler named Bartz, resting in the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover an old man in the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been on her way to the Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring a cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.[15]
Eventually, the party comes to discover that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable.[16] The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. King Tycoon, who was controlled by Exdeath to destroy the last Crystal, sacrifices himself to save the others. Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives by a meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others resolve that the fight is not Galuf's alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.[17]
The party meets Xezat, one of Galuf's companions and a former Warrior of Dawn, and learn that Bartz's father was part of their group. Joining forces, they deactivate the barrier around Exdeath's castle, but at the cost of Xezat's life. They then learn of Exdeath's origins, traveling to the Guardian Tree to dispel the seals. Exdeath anticipates the party's actions and torches Moore Forest, ensnaring the group. Krile arrives to help but is herself trapped by the warlock's powers. At the sight of his granddaughter's capture, Galuf frees himself and battles Exdeath to the point of death, refusing to fall until the creature flees. Collapsing from his wounds, Galuf dies despite the party's efforts to save him, imparting his abilities to Krile.[18] The party pursues Exdeath to his tower and defeats him, but the remaining Crystals shatter and the worlds are reunited.
For a time, it seems Exdeath has been truly destroyed, and the party celebrates in Tycoon. Bartz, however, is contacted by the sage Ghido. Meeting with him, a thorn suddenly leaps from Krile's palm, manifesting as Exdeath, now resurrected and fully in command of the Void. With it, he removes entire towns and kingdoms from existence, tossing them into a tear in reality.
Fortunately for the party, the reunification of worlds has opened the pathways to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath at the center of the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it.[19] Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. In the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.[20]
","Final Fantasy V includes many standard role-playing elements as well as renovated features introduced in earlier Final Fantasy games. Players navigate from a top-down perspective; a traversable overworld connects the various towns, dungeons, and other points of interest. The player can traverse the overworld by foot, Chocobo, hydra-guided ship, wind drake, or airship, depending on the situation. Most towns contain scattered inns for resting, shops for purchasing equipment, and people from whom the player can gain information. The player may also embark on several side quests that become available as the story progresses.[2] Characters grow in strength by gaining experience points from random encounters with monsters on the overworld or in a dungeon. Experience culminates in a ""level up"", in which character attributes such as hit points and magic power increase. A menu-based management system allows the player to equip, heal, and change each character's selected job outside of battle as well as to save the game's progress.[3]
Final Fantasy V is the second Final Fantasy game to use the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which time flows continuously for both the player and enemies during combat.[3] This system was first established in Final Fantasy IV, but in that game, there was no way to visibly anticipate which character's turn would come up next.[4] In Final Fantasy V, the player can see which playable character's turn is next in battle, in the form of a time gaugeâor ""ATB Bar""âwhich fills according to a character's speed. When the selected character's turn arrives, the player can execute one of several commands, such as attacking the enemy with an equipped weapon, using a special ability or item, or changing the character's row position.[5] The ATB mechanic with a gauge, as seen in Final Fantasy V, would be used in the four following main titles in the series and remains a staple mechanic of the franchise.[6]
The main feature of the gameplay of Final Fantasy V is the Job System. Players can freely select jobs (also called ""classes"") for their characters to master, allowing each character to gain special abilities and potentially master all 22 jobs (26 in the Game Boy Advance version). Each character begins with only the ""Freelancer"" class; to gain access to new jobs, players must acquire crystal shards.[3] This system is  an improved version of the one in Final Fantasy III; several older jobs were either reused or revamped for Final Fantasy V, such as the Black Mage and Thief. The game also introduces several classes to the series, including the Blue Mage, Time Mage, and Mime.[7] Each of these classes has been featured in numerous Final Fantasy installments since.
Once the player gains access to the job system, characters begin to earn a separate form of experienceâAbility Pointsâin conjunction with regular experience points.[3] Characters gain job levels after accumulating AP; as with regular levels, the required amount of experience increases after each job level. AP and job levels do not transfer from class to class. As job levels increase, new skills become available for the character to use in a new form of customization; characters learn job-specific abilities that may be transferred to a new job. For example, a character with the Knight job who has also earned job levels as a Black Mage may set Black Magic as a secondary command, enabling both Black Mage and Knight abilities in battle. The nature of these abilities varies; while some serve as special commands in battle, others may be innate to the class or activated automatically when conditions are met, such as the Thief's ""Caution"" skill, which prevents rear attacks from enemies.[8] This system allows for deeper customization of characters.[9]
"
Final Fantasy VI Advance,,2006,Square Enix,"Square Enix (Japan), Nintendo (overseas)","NA, PAL, JP","Instead of the strictly medieval fantasy settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy VI is set in a world that also has prominent steampunk influences. The structure of society is similar to that of the latter half of the 19th century, with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game,[6] and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution. During the first half of the game, the planet is referred to as the World of Balance, and is divided into three lush continents. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges, the southern continent has been mostly subjugated by the cruel Gestahl Empire, and the eastern continent is home to the Veldt, a massive wilderness inhabited by monsters from all over the world. An apocalyptic event mid-game transforms the planet into the World of Ruin; its withering landmasses are fractured into numerous islands surrounding a larger continent.
The game alludes to a conflict known as the ""War of the Magi,"" which occurred one thousand years prior to the beginning of the game. In this conflict, three quarreling entities known as the ""Warring Triad"" used innocent humans as soldiers by transforming them into enslaved magical beings called Espers. The Triad realized their wrongdoings; they freed the espers and sealed their own powers inside three stone statues.[7] As a precaution, the espers sealed off both the statues and themselves from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology.[8] At the game's opening, the Empire has taken advantage of the weakening barrier between the human and esper domains, capturing several espers in the process. Using these espers as a power source, the Empire has created ""Magitek"", a craft that combines magic with machinery (including mechanical infantry) and infuses humans with magical powers.[9] The Empire is opposed by the Returners, a rebel organization seeking to free the subjugated lands.
Final Fantasy VI features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love.[10] Other primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Roni Figaro, a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners;[11] Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar's independent brother, who fled the royal court to hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends when Kefka poisoned the kingdom's water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler, thrill seeker, and owner of the world's only known airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm's elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy on the Veldt; Mog, a pike-toting Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal sasquatch also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog's persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.
Most of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who serves as one of the game's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The clownish Kefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights, rendering him insane; his actions throughout the game reflect his demented nature.[12] The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief. A handful of characters have reappeared in later games. Final Fantasy SGI, a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation, featured polygon-based 3D renderings of Locke, Terra, and Shadow.[13]
In the town of Narshe, Terra participates in an Imperial mission to seize a powerful Esper encased in ice. Upon locating it, a magical reaction occurs between Terra and the Esper; as a result, the soldiers accompanying Terra are killed and Terra is knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, Terra is informed that the Empire had been using a device called a ""slave crown"" to control her actions. With the crown now removed, Terra cannot remember anything more than her name and her rare ability to use magic unaided.[14] Terra is then introduced to an organization known as the ""Returners"", who she agrees to help in their revolution against the Empire.[15] The Returners learn that Imperial soldiers, led by Kefka, are planning another attempt to seize the frozen Esper. After repelling Kefka's attack, Terra experiences another magical reaction with the frozen Esper; she transforms into a creature resembling an Esper and flies to another continent.[16] Upon locating Terra, the party is confronted by an Esper named Ramuh, who informs the group that Terra may require the assistance of another Esper imprisoned in the Imperial capital city of Vector.[17]
At Vector, the party attempts to rescue several Espers; however, the Espers are already dying from Magitek experiments and choose instead to offer their lives to the party by transforming into magicite.[18] The group returns to Terra and observes a reaction between her and the magicite ""Maduin"". The reaction calms Terra and restores her memory; she reveals that she is the half-human, half-Esper child of Maduin and a human woman.[19] With this revelation, the Returners ask Terra to convince the Espers to join their cause. To do this, she travels to the sealed gate between the human and Esper worlds.[20] However, unbeknownst to the party, the Empire also uses Terra to gain access to the Esper world.[21][22] There, Emperor Gestahl and Kefka retrieve the statues of the Warring Triad, raising a landmass called the Floating Continent. The group confronts Emperor Gestahl and Kefka at the Floating Continent, whereupon Kefka, whose mental state has progressively declined over the course of the story, usurps and murders Gestahl. Kefka then tampers with the alignment of the statues, which upsets the balance of magic and destroys most of the surface of the world.
One year later, Celes awakens on a deserted island. She learns that Kefka is using the Warring Triad to rule the world in a tyrannical god-like manner, destroying whole villages who oppose him and causing all life to slowly wither away.[23] After Celes escapes the island, she searches for her lost comrades, who are found scattered throughout the ruined world. They come to terms with their situation and resolve to confront Kefka and end his reign, with Terra additionally accepting her half-Esper heritage and finding a new purpose in life in fighting for a better future. The group infiltrates Kefka's tower and destroys the Warring Triad before confronting Kefka himself, who has descended into nihilism as a result of his madness and plans to destroy all of existence as a means of self-validation. However, the group successfully destroys Kefka in battle, at which point magic and Espers disappear from the world; despite this, Terra is able to survive by hanging onto the human half of her existence.[24] The group escapes from Kefka's tower as it collapses and flies away while watching the world rejuvenate itself.
","Like previous Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI consists of four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.[2]
The game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful information and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate side-quests. Dungeons appear as a variety of areas, including caves, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Dungeons may feature puzzles and mazes, with some dungeons requiring the player to divide the characters into multiple parties which must work together to advance through the dungeon.[2]
Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four characters may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.[3]
Another element is the Desperation Attack, a powerful attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles under a variety of different names, including Limit Breaks, Trances, and Overdrives.[4] Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.[3]
Characters in Final Fantasy VI can be equipped with a variety of weapons, armor and, particular to this entry, powerful accessories known as ""Relics"". Weapons and armor increase combat capability mostly by increasing statistics and adding beneficial effects to attacks. By comparison, Relics have a variety of uses and effects, are almost entirely interchangeable among party members, and are extended in sophistication to alter basic battle commands and exceed normal limitations of the game's systems.
Although in Final Fantasy VI only two playable characters start the game with the ability to use magic, magic may later be taught to almost all other playable characters through the game's introduction of magicite and the Espers that magicite shards contain. ""Espers"" are the game's incarnation of the series' trope of ""summons"", powerful monstrous beings, many of which are recurring throughout the series, such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin. Besides those returning from previous entries, Final Fantasy VI features approximately two dozen of them in total, with more added to later versions of the game.
The setting and plot of the game revolve heavily around Espers and their remains when deceased, which are referred to as ""magicite"". Each piece of magicite has a specific set of magic spells that a character can learn when they are equipped with it in the menu. Additionally, some pieces of magicite grant a statistical bonus to a character when they gain a level. Finally, when a character equips a piece of magicite, they may summon the corresponding Esper during battle.[5]

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance,,2003,Square Enix,"Square Enix (Japan), Nintendo (overseas)","NA, PAL, JP","The story of Tactics Advance revolves around three primary characters: Marche Radiuju, the main character who battles the dream worlds of his friends; Ritz Malheur, a stubborn girl who speaks her mind and changes sides in her struggle for self-acceptance; and Mewt Randell, a boy whose mother died that discovers a magical entity that changes the world into the world of Ivalice. There are also secondary characters, such as Doned Radiuju, Marche's little brother who does not desire to return to the real world, since he is sick in the real world and healthy in the dream one; and Cid Randell, Mewt's father who becomes the Judgemaster of Ivalice.[6]
Within Ivalice, there are other characters that help advance the plot. Some characters befriended Marche, such as the moogles Montblanc and Nono; Ezel Berbier, a Nu Mou troublemaker and self-proclaimed genius; and Shara, a Viera archer who befriends Ritz. There are other characters who antagonize Marche, including Babus Swain, a Nu Mou Royal mage in Mewt's service; Llednar Twem, a mysterious enforcer who replaces the Judges when they become independent of the Palace; and Queen Remedi, who is the ruler of Ivalice and was in the Gran Grimoire itself in a form modeled after Mewt's deceased mother.[6]
Ivalice is a world created by four ordinary children: Marche Radiuju, a new student and resident of St. Ivalice and its school; Mewt Randell, a shy boy still attached to the memory of his late mother; Ritz Malheur, an assertive and outspoken classmate of Marche and Mewt; and Doned Radiuju, Marche's younger, handicapped brother and a big fan of fantasy novels and video games.  Mewt comes across a dusty old tome in a local used bookstore and eagerly wishes to show it to his friends. Unaware that the book is the legendary Gran Grimoire, Mewt brings the book over to Marche's house along with Ritz. The old book is written in a language none of them have ever seen before, and a single inscription reads: ""Alta oron, Sondus kameela"".[8] The next morning, Marche wakes up in the world of Ivalice. The fantasy Ivalice is supposedly a reincarnation of Mewt's memories from a Final Fantasy game.[9]
Marche is separated from the others, and immediately begins a quest to return home.  Even after realizing how much better his life is in the new Ivalice, he believes that none of it is real and is even more determined to return to his home when he realizes that everyone in town has been dragged into the dream as well, many of whom are now suffering under Mewt's rule or are being slaughtered by the adventuring Clans that populate the world.[10]  The other children, and Mewt's father Cid, slowly realize through Marche's efforts that the world has been shaped according to their wishes. Mewt is no longer being teased, is reunited with his deceased mother, and is now the Prince of Ivalice; Ritz no longer has her white albinic hair, instead having the silky red hair which she always wanted; Doned can now walk and is no longer sickly; Marche is suddenly athletic and popular; Cid is the highest-ranking official in the nation; and all of them now live in Final Fantasy, the video game the children all love.[11]
Eventually Marche succeeds in his quest to return Ivalice to normal. He achieves this by destroying the crystals, or world threads, of Ivalice, defeating Llednar Twem (the manifestation of Mewt's negative emotions), and killing the Li-Grim, the physical manifestation of the book's wish-based magic that had been masquerading as Mewt's mother, Queen Remedi.[12]  He teaches the other children in the process that they cannot live in fantasy but must learn to live with their misfortunes in reality.  The other children are wiser from the experience, as the ending reveals them all to have become happy with themselves.
In addition to the main plot, there are two side plots: the Redwing Arc and the Judge Arc. The Redwing Arc centers around the Redwings clan, a foreign crime ring, their subordinate clan Borzoi, and their smuggled foreign monsters. The other is the Judge Arc, unlockable after beating the main three hundred missions. This serves as an alternative ending where Marche never goes on his quest and stays in Ivalice, overthrows several corrupt judges, and becomes next in line for Cid's judge sword.[13]
","In Tactics Advance, turn-based tactical battles take place on a three-dimensional isometric field. The player takes the role of Marche, a clan leader; he must organize the clan's members and advance their status through missions that are offered in pubs.[2] The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy Tactics characters execute their actions instantly.[3]
Missions are tasks undertaken by a clan. There are four types of missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story.[3][4] In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.
Some missions, typically dispatch missions, require a special item to be in possession in order to accept the mission. Others require a dispatch character to have a specific job class. In regards to items, this may mean another mission must be done to get an item that would allow you to perform the later mission.
The world map is initially empty except for the starting location; it is customized as the player wins location ""tokens"" after certain missions. These tokens represent different terrains and settlements, such as plains, mountains, deserts, forests, and towns, that can be placed in slots on the world map. Items are rewarded to the player depending on the placement of the tokens.[2][3] Ivalice also introduces areas called Jagds, lawless slums that Judges avoid. Jagd is a German word which means the hunt. Jagds are the only places in the game in which a character can die; everywhere else, they are protected from death by the Judges and are simply knocked out.
Tactics Advance also offers multiplayer capability for two players. Players may cooperate or compete using a link-cable peripheral, and also trade items and party members. Additional missions and items are also offered when players link.[2]
There are 34 ""jobs"" in Tactics Advance that govern a character's stats, equipment, and abilities. Most items that can be equipped have various abilities assigned to them, each available for use by characters of a certain job while the item is equipped. When a battle is completed, characters will receive Ability Points (AP) distributed over their currently equipped weapons or items (such as armor). Once a target amount of AP has been accumulated for a given ability, the character will master that ability, allowing the character to use them at any time, regardless of items equipped and job chosen. Mastery of abilities in different jobs will eventually allow the character access to more jobs. For example, if a human unit wishes to change jobs to Paladin, it needs to master at least two ""action"" abilities from the Soldier job.[5]
Units have a primary job which determines the stat boosts they receive when they level up and the attributes associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, but has the stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped weapon. In the previous example, any abilities that require the possession of a great bow, will not be allowed for use if the character has a Katana equipped.[5]
Tactics Advance also introduces five playable races: Humans, the small rodentlike Moogles, the strong lizard-like Bangaa, the agile rabbit-like Viera, and the magically-skilled Nu Mou. Certain jobs are only available to certain races. Along with the abilities obtained with experience, each race has a guardian beast called a ""Totema"" to represent whom and which can be summoned to whose aid when a member of that race has 10 Judge Points, that is after your clan has defeated that Totema as part of the main story line.[6]
One arbitrary game mechanic of Tactics Advance is the Laws system. Laws are set by Judges, invincible arbiters present at each battle, with some exceptions.  Laws may forbid the use of certain weapons, items, elemental spells, or status changes. Breaking a law results in punishment by Carding, the receipt of a red or yellow card. Imprisonment happens if a character infringes a law twice or knocks out another unit with a forbidden ability or weapon. However, Jagds have no Judges or laws; units knocked out in the Jagds will die and permanently leave the clan if they are not revived by the end of the battle.[7]
To offset the difficulty of having things forbidden for use, there are certain things that are recommended by the Judges, and therefore grant Judge Points if used. Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains the ability to use law cards, which can add laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect.[7]

Final Fight One,,2001,Capcom,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","The game is set in a fictional city on the Atlantic coast in the United States named Metro City. According to the game's intro, in the 1990s (or 1989 in the Japanese version), the city's crime rate reached alarming levels, but since the election of pro wrestler turned politician Mike Haggar as the new Mayor, Metro City was changed and cleaned up drastically. Under his run, Haggar managed to suppress the crime rate of the city to its lowest points. While the citizens of Metro City were thankful for Haggar's hard work in curbing crime, the Mad Gear Gang, who had served as the dominant criminal organization of Metro City would not go down so easily. Under the leadership of the crooked businessman Belger, the group attempted to bribe Haggar with a large payoff to keep him from going after them, to which Haggar refused. Still determined to bring Haggar under their rule like the last mayor before him, Mad Gear had proceeded into kidnapping his daughter Jessica and creating further unrest among the citizens of the city. When Haggar found out about his daughter's abduction, he becomes furious and decides to take his fight against Mad Gear to a personal level. Seeking additional manpower, Haggar recruits Cody Travers: an expert fighter and Jessica's boyfriend, as well as Guy: a ninja in training and Cody's good friend/rival. Together, the three dedicate themselves to the complete eradication of the Mad Gear Gang, as well as the safe rescue of Jessica from their clutches.
The game gained notoriety for its morbid continue screen, where whatever character the player was using is shown tied to a chair with a bundle of dynamite on the table in front of him. In the 10 seconds the player has to insert another quarter, both Cody and Guy struggle to escape their bonds, while Haggar is feverishly blowing in a futile attempt to extinguish the lit fuse. If the player activates the continue option, a knife falls from the ceiling, disconnecting the fuse from the bomb.
","Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.
The controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform jump attacks. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.
Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.
Final Fight consists of six stages or ""rounds"", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.

Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade (Fire Emblem: Fuuin no Tsurugi),,2002,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,JP,NaN,"Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade is a tactical role-playing game in which players control main protagonist Roy and his growing army as they take part in battle across the land of Elibe. Gameplay is broken up into maps bookended by story sequences, with the completion of each map advancing the storyline.[5][6] When the game is completed for the first time, a new difficulty level is unlocked.[7]
Battles take place on grid-based self-contained maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break after a number of uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes.[5][6][8][9] Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated and Roy seizes the boss's location.[5] If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them from the rest of the game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.[5][8]
Each unit has their own character class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics.[5][6] A Support system exists where characters who remain next to each other for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.[8][9]

Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade|Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken JP,,2003,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Fire Emblem is a tactical role-playing game where players take the role of story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes the role of an unseen tactician directing the player army.[6] The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress.[7] In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's various Arenas or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.[6][8]
Battles in the story take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act.[6][7] During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as fog of war or elements of the environment that can be manipulated to one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle.[7][9] Units are split between player, enemy and allied non-player character (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must clear a map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; it can also be regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.[6][7]
Each unit is governed by a character class system, with their class affecting what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains experience points (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's class can be upgraded to a more powerful version with access to new items and weapons.[6][7][9] If a unit is defeated in battle, they are subject to permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game ends and the player must restart the level.[7][10]
Weapon strengths and weaknesses are governed by the series' Weapons Triangle system; axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Bows are independent of the system, being effective against airborne units. A similar system, dubbed the Magic Trinity in-game, governs how different types of spells react; elemental magic is strong against light, light against dark and dark against elemental.[6][7] The strength of weapon types assigned to a particular unit is raised through usage, with its rank ranging from E to S, with S being the highest possible affinity with a promoted character. Characters also have a Support system, where talking in battle strengthens two characters' relationship, and consequently provides stat boosts. The higher the Support rank, which ranges from ""C"" to ""A"", the better the boost.[6]
Outside the main campaign, players can battle against the game's artificial intelligence (AI) in the Link Arena: after building a team, the player fights a battle against their own units controlled by the game AI. Fire Emblem also features a Link Arena multiplayer option in which up to four players can link up and do battle with teams of characters from the single-player save file. Players choose up to five characters and equip them like in the main story. During battle, each player takes turns to attack with one character. Weapons are selected automatically for each battle. Victory is determined either by surviving a period of time or aggregating the highest number of points.[6][9]

Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones|Fire Emblem: Seima no Kousek JP,,2004,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is a tactical role-playing game where players take the role of royal siblings Eirika and Ephraim during separate campaigns as they fight hostile forces invading their homeland, along with allies acquired on their journey.[5] The world's setting of Magvel is navigated using an overworld map, with routes going to different battle maps unlocked as the story progresses. In addition to story-related maps and dungeons, optional dungeons exist where chosen units can freely battle enemies, earning experience points.  Each time a unit earns 100 experience points, that unit will gain a level and some of their stats will randomly increase.  All characters can progress up to the 20-level cap.[5][6][7]  After a character has leveled up to 10, it has the option to be evolved using a class-specific item. A notable change from earlier games is that multiple options are available for class evolution: for instance, a Cavalier can evolve into either a Paladin or a Great Knight.[8]
Battles use a turn-based system, with player, allied, and enemy units each taking turns to moving across a grid-based battlefield.  Players can end their turn at any time, at which point the allied or enemy units can move. In each battle, the player is given command of a limited number of units and an objective to complete.  Each unit's character class determines their abilities, available weapons, strength, and range of movement.  For example, mounted characters can move within the remainder of their movement range if they traded with or assisted another player unit in a shorter range.[6][8] Other units have the ability to ""rescue"" units, lowering their own stats while removing the rescued unit from harm.  Depending on a unit's class and stats, items can be used heal or inflict status ailments such as ""Poison"" (a unit loses health each turn), ""Berserk"" (a unit attacks nearby units regardless of association), and immobilization ailments such as ""Sleep"" and ""Petrify"".
A key element of battle is the Weapons Triangle, a rock-paper-scissors mechanic governing which type of weapon is more effective against another.  Weapon types vary from close-range melee weapons like swords and axes to long-range weapons such as bows and magical staves.  Various items gathered during missions, such as healing items and weapons, can be traded with other units within the army, or sold at vendors found on the world map.[6][7]  All items degrade with use and will break after a certain number of uses.  Different weapons also feature a minimum skill level for use, requiring units to train with that weapon type to earn the proper rank, which ranges from E to A, and then to S, the highest rank.  When a unit reaches S rank with one weapon, all other weapon skills are locked at A rank.[6][9][10][8]
Certain units which share a particular affinity stat can benefit from mid-battle Support Conversations.  After spending a certain number of turns within a few spaces of each other, they gain the option to engage in a Support Conversation when occupying adjacent spaces.  Each pair of units can have up to three Support Conversations, with each successive Support granting both units better stat bonuses in future battles if they are within three spaces of each other.[6]
When a unit falls in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them from the rest of the campaign unless the player restarts the game from a previous save file.  Some character deaths, such as those of Eirika and Ephraim, end the game and require a restart from a save file.[6][8]
In addition to the single-player, the game includes a local multiplayer option where four players can take chosen units into the Link Arena.  Victory goes to the last group standing or to the party with the highest score depending on the match conditions.[6][11]  Permanent death is disabled in the Link Arena.[11]

Flame of Recca: The Game (Rekka no HonÅ: The Game),,2001,,Konami,JP,"Flame of Recca follows the story of a teenage boy named Recca Hanabishi, who is interested in ninja and claims to be one himself. He often gets into fights because he made it publicly known that the person who manages to defeat him will earn his services as a loyal ninja. Despite this, he eventually pledges his loyalty and services as a ninja to Yanagi Sakoshita, a girl with the innate ability to heal any wound/injury, because of her kindness and compassion. Recca soon discovers that he possesses the innate ability to control/manipulate flames, and eventually learns that he is actually the son of the sixth generation leader of the Hokage, a ninja clan that was wiped out in 1576, roughly 400 years before the series' present day.[4][5]
The Hokage ninjas wielded mystical objects called madÅgu (é­å°å·), which are referred to as ""psychic devices"" or ""mystical weapons"" in the English versions of the series. MadÅgu grant their users special abilities, such as allowing their users to manipulate certain elements (as in the case of the FÅ«jin, which allows its wielder to manipulate the element of wind) and enhancing their user's strength/skills (as in the case of the Dosei no Wa, which increases its user's physical strength and the Idaten, which increases its user's running speed). Oda Nobunaga had invaded the Hokage in 1576 for the purpose of acquiring these weapons, and the series' main antagonist, KÅran Mori, is searching for a madÅgu that will grant him eternal life. Recca and his friends become entangled in Mori's quest for eternal life as he attempts to kidnap Yanagi, believing that her healing powers will help him achieve immortality. This leads them to join the Ura ButÅ Satsujin, a tournament wherein the warriors that wield madÅgu gather to battle each other. After winning the tournament, Recca and his teammates discover that Mori was on his way to acquire the TendÅ Jigoku (å¤©å å°ç, Heaven and Hell), a madÅgu said to grant its user eternal life, and once again attempt to stop him.
Though it begins by following the same basic storyline, the Flame of Recca anime series ends right after the Ura ButÅ Satsujin ends, while the manga goes on to include the subplot involving the TendÅ Jigoku. The anime also omits certain characters from the story,[6] and several of the characters' physical appearances are slightly different from the manga.[7]

Flushed Away,,2006,Altron,D3 Publisher,"NA, PAL","Much different compared to the film, Roderick St. James lives in an apartment, in Kensington, with his owners, until they go away for a holiday. Gilbert and Sulivan, who weren't seen in the film, all help Roddy out with his obstacle course and fencing skills. As they explore more, they hear an explosion, coming from the kitchen. They found that Sid has raided the kitchen and is planning to stay. Roddy schemes to get rid of Sid, but quickly backfires as Sid flushes him down the toilet, thinking of it as a trap. As soon as Roddy ends up in another world, Ratropolis, he bumps into Socketset, who gives him his first task: Collect a jar of flies.
Meanwhile, Rita sneaks into the Toad's lair, grabs the ruby and after escaping Spike and Whitey, escapes on her Jammy Dodger. Roddy investigates but bumps into Rita, who then decide to team up to escape Spike, Whitey and the other rats. After escaping the rats, using ammunition and speed, Rita swerves the Jammy Dodger out of control and crashes onto a platform, where Spike and Whitey capture them both and take them to the Toad. They are sent to the freezer, locked up, and be frozen for theft of the precious ruby. However, Roddy and Rita escape and the Toad orders his henchrats to chase the escapees down.
Roddy desperately tries to catch up to Rita, while avoiding either Spike, Whitey and the Toad's henchrats along the way. He makes it to the bridge, jumps off the walkway and lands onto the Jammy Dodger, spraining his back while trying to escape the henchrats. Rita allows Roddy to stay on the Jammy Dodger, as he had dropped in. He then, painfully, thanks Rita for the lift.
Later, Roddy is claimed ""The Chosen One"" by the prophet rat and is told to speak with Charlie Wu, who gives Roddy a rescue mission, to save the orphanage from flooding. In order to do this, he and Rita must journey, via the Jammy Dodger. They reach the clogged drain and as soon as Roddy launches the catapult, it releases the water and it starts draining too fast, giving Roddy and Rita the signal to get clear. Charlie Wu is pleased that his children are safe. Then, Socketset gives Roddy another job: Collect another jar full of flies.
Upon exploring the caves, Roddy finds a deeper cave, where he comes across an arachnid, who sees Roddy as lunch. Roddy defeats her and then retrieves a new sword, which is a reference to Disney's The Sword in the Stone. After a few side missions, from Socketset and Charlie Wu, Roddy ventures through Little Soho and Chinatown, to complete his side tasks. As Roddy and Rita venture more on the Jammy Dodger, they hear a lot of cheering and shouting going on. It turns out that England has made it to the World Cup Finals and the rats go down to Little Soho to stir things up. After encountering hooligans, Roddy finds a door that is blocked by wooden and metal crates. Eventually, after the puzzle is solved and the door is unlocked, both Roddy and Rita can continue their journey. However, they find that the fans have decided to have a battle called ""Castle Siege."" In order for England to win, Germany's flags must be eliminated. England wins and Germany loses, so Roddy and Rita continue their journey.
Along the way, they encounter Le Frog and his henchfrogs. As soon as Rita speeds and crashes the Jammy Dodger on the dock, completely knocking Le Frog and his henchfrogs off their feet. Le Frog and his henchmen split apart, so does Roddy and Rita. Roddy faces Le Frog and then defeats him. Upon leaving, Le Frog gets up and tries to get Roddy back, but is knocked out by a falling chandelier, that had the rope cut by Roddy's sword. As Roddy and Rita leave, they are captured by Spike and Whitey and are taken to the Toad's lair.
Once they arrive at the Toad's lair, the Toad tells Roddy and Rita his greatest plan to flush all the rodents, with a giant wave, by opening the floodgate. However, Roddy and Rita soon tell the Toad that thousands of toilets, in London, are used, as many people are watching the football on TV. When it is halftime, many people will go to the toilets, dispose of their liquids and then flush it down the drain. When the toilets start flushing, it will cause a huge wave that will destroy the city the rats live. The Toad, enraged about having his plan being revealed, kicks both Roddy and Rita off, unaware that they are hanging on to each other, and then tells his henchrats to stop Roddy and Rita from escaping.
The final battle occurs when Roddy is faced with dodging the Toad's throwable objects, by hitting each console 3 times. Then, Rita is faced to fight Fat Barry, Lady Killer and Thimblenose Ted, by using, everything she can, to weaken them and make it easy for them to take a hit. She also uses some lights, blinding Thimblenose Ted and by blowing Lady Killer's wig off his head with a wind from the vent. After the henchrats are defeated, Roddy and Rita's final task is to defeat the Toad. Rita's bungee manages to weaken the supports and the Toad is left hanging, with his tongue stuck to something, as he is defeated. Afterwards, Rita is asked by Roddy if she needs a first mate, which she obliges and runs off. However, Roddy runs after her and lands perfectly on the Jammy Dodger, with Rita controlling the Jammy Dodger, allowing it to speed up, making Roddy fall over. However, Rita then tells Roddy that he can be the captain, every other day. As the screen fades out, the words 'The End' with a question mark at the end, appear on the centre of the screen, ending the game on a cliffhanger.
","Flushed Away is based around platform gameplay, with the player controlling the two main characters from the film and guiding them through hazard-filled environments. Environments and enemies are based on those in the film, although several areas and creatures not seen in the film are also included. Interspersed throughout the game are mini-game sequences involving shooting enemies with a golf-ball firing turret, and taking control of a boat in a chase sequence.[3] Some multiplayer minigames are also included, based around puzzle and shoot-'em-up mechanics.[1]

Frogger Advance: The Great Quest,No,2002,KCEA,Konami,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Frogger Advance features traditional 2D side-scrolling platforming mechanics rather than the top-down gameplay of the original Frogger arcade game. The player's primary objective is simply to reach the end of each stage, overcoming the obstacles and enemies in their path by means of jumping, or attacking. This is made easier by Frogger's special abilities, which he is granted at predetermined points throughout the game by a recurring frog fairy character. These abilities include the Super Tongue (a more powerful close range attack), Glide, Double Jump, and an underwater forward thrust.
The game is divided into several different worlds, all of which consist of three regular stages and one special stage featuring a boss character, or a special task, which has to be completed within a time limit. Upon completion of each of these worlds, the player's performance is graded in a range from A+ to F- according to how many coins were collected, how many hidden gems were found and how many lives were lost. If the player manages to complete the entire game with A+ grades in all worlds, a special, more conclusive ending slideshow is played.

By balancing elemental forces with the help of nine Guardians, she keeps the various planets in her domain stable and her people content. However, the powers of the Queen and the Guardians fade over time, and successors must be appointed. In the first game and its various remakes, the protagonist is a 17-year-old girl named Angelique Limoges who has been chosen by the current Queen and her aide Dia as one of two candidates from the Royal Smallney Girls' Academy to become the next Queen. She is transported to the Flying City to begin her final examination.
Each of the candidates is given a land to populate. Whoever finishes populating their land first wins and becomes the next Queen. It is done with the help of nine Guardians who use their powers to make the people of the candidate's land happy, or to devastate their rival's lands. Along the way, the candidates become friends with the Guardians and can fall in love. If they choose love, they forfeit their chance to become Queen, but will live happily ever after.
The story expands in later titles, but most entries in the series feature one of a succession of girls named Angelique as the protagonist, with ever larger casts of characters. The roster of potential love interests swells to 19 characters in later titles.

Galaxy Angel,,2002,,Marvelous Entertainment,JP,"Commander Takuto Meyers is a commander of the 2nd Frontier Fleet, when exiled Prince Eonia launches his coup, Most of the Royal Family on the homeworld were killed via orbital bombardment, and large portions of the Imperial Fleet were destroyed in the surprise attack. As Commander Meyers is unable to contact 2nd Fleet HQ, he waits on standby for orders, until three members of the Angel Wing arrive, with a large fleet chasing them, which turns out to be unmanned ships. After destroying the fleet, Meyers takes his fleet and follows them back to where the Elsior is hiding, the battleship usually used only by the Imperial Guards for ceremonies and meets his old Instructor Lufte, now Commodore, who charges Meyers with commanding the Elsior and the Angel Wing in escorting Prince Shiva, the only survivor of the Royal Family, to the Rhombe system where loyalist forces are gathering for a counter offensive as the 2nd fleet has already been destroyed. Before the engines can be repaired however, more enemy ships arrive, and rather than risking discovery, Commodore Lufte takes command of the remaining fleet and draws the enemy ships away, while the Elsior remains and makes its way to Rhombe, fighting off enemy attacks along the way, including elements of the Imperial Fleet changed sides to side with Prince Eonia.
While attempting to meet up with the 3rd fleet stationed at Rhombe, the Elsior discovers destroyed remnants of the 3rd fleet and runs into a trap by Prince Eonia's main fleet. While fighting the forces, they receive another message from the 3rd fleet with a new rendezvous point, after fighting their way through the enemy fleet to the rendezvous point, allied reinforcements arrive and force the enemy forces to retreat, Commodore Lufte having evaded enemy forces and reached the Rhombe System ahead of the Elsior. Afterwards, the Loyalist fleet launches an operation to destroy Prince Eonia's main fleet at the Nadler system, and they inflict a serious defeat on the enemy and the commanding admirals (and other high-ranking officers of the Imperial Navy) decide to hold a ball in Prince Shiva's honour, and plan to transfer Meyers away to command another fleet while the Angel Wings and the Elsior remain behind to guard Prince Shiva on Fargo, an orbital city around the planet Rhombe. On a routine visit to the ship's hangar, Meyers bumps into a strange girl called Noah, who wants Meyers to give him one of the Emblem Frames. When Meyers refuses, Noah gets angry, says that she will make more and stronger ones, and runs off, disappearing just around the corner. Shrugging the incident off, Meyers takes his chosen love with him to the ball, and while there Prince Eonia shows up with several soldiers to try and take Prince Shiva into his Custody, although Prince Shiva refuses. Shots are fired, and it is revealed that Prince Eonia and the soldiers are just holograms and are not physically present, at this point Eonia's fleet launches a sneak attack while most of the Loyalist fleet is docked and not combat ready, and inflicts serious damage on the port facilities.
Meyers heads back to the ship with Prince Shiva, and after the enemy fleet retreats, the Black Moon, an identical counterpart to the White Moon(a planet sized structure) shows up and fires a massive laser that slices Rhombe in half and destroys much of Fargo and the Loyalist fleet. Meyers and the Angel Wing fight a desperate battle to reach the Black Moon, which is constantly producing attack satellites and unmanned ships, before Noah unleashes an EMP like blast that leaves the Elsior, the Emblem Frames and the Loyalist Fleet powerless except for sensors and communications, before attacking them as they lay helpless. While the situation looks grim, suddenly the Elsior and the Emblem Frames have their power restored to above their original levels, and the Emblem Frames all grow wings. They manage to break through the defensive line and damage the Black Moon which causes Prince Eonia to back off for now, turning it into a stalemate, although afterwards the Emblem Frames lose their wings and their power levels drop to below normal.
As the loyalist fleet gathers on the other side of Rhombe, Commodore Lufte takes command as everyone higher-ranking was MIA and presumed dead. Elsior's chief engineer, Creta and Prince Shiva shed some light on the abilities of the Elsior and the Emblem Frames, and also that there is a weapon possibly capable of destroying the Black Moon, but it is stored in the White Moon. While briefing Commodore Lufte on the situation, he mentions that Noah was spotted on other ships and the port facilities before the attack, although when guards attempted to question her, she disappeared into smoke right before their eyes. The Elsior and the Loyalist fleet then head to the White Moon in order to retrieve the weapon, as Sherry, Prince Eonia's second in command, tries to stop them along the way, but fails, finally sacrificing herself as she tries to ram her flagship into the Elsior, although the Angel Wing manages to destroy her ship just before impact. At the White Moon, Lady Shatoyan, the Holy Mother of the White Moon, reveals that the White Moon is a weapons producing factory just like the Black Moon, but the people who found the White Moon decided to keep it a secret, and only use the technology there for good. Lady Shatoyan then lifts the limiters on the Emblem Frames and installs the Chrono Break Canon on the Elsior.
In the Final Battle, after defeating the Hell Hounds, Prince Eonia's elite fighter wing piloting copied Emblem Frames, Noah causes their frames to grow wings as well by altering their structure, in the process causing the fighters to consume their pilots and turn them into soulless zombies. After destroying their fighters, the Elsior gets into position and destroys Prince Eonia's flagship with the Chrono Break Canon, after which Noah reveals that Noah was just a form used to trick Prince Eonia, whom wanted to use the Lost Technology to create an age of peace and prosperity for everyone, into launching his coup so that the Black Moon could unite with the White Moon and evolve further. While the Black Moon pulls the White Moon out of orbit in an attempt to unite with it, Meyers and the Angel Wing breaks through a large screen of attack satellites to use the Chrono Break Canon on the Black Moon, but before it can finish charging, the Black Moon brings the full weight of its power on them, disabling them, all except for the Emblem Frame piloted by Meyer's chosen heroine.

Gauntlet / Rampart,,2005,EC Interactive Games,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game is set within a series of top-down, third-person perspective mazes where the object is to find and touch the designated exit in every level. An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase the player's character's health, unlock doors, gain more points, and give magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen.[11]
Each player controls one of four playable fantasy-based characters: Thor, a warrior; Merlin, a wizard; Thyra, a valkyrie; or Questor, an Elf. The characters are named on the cabinet artwork, but in-game they are referred only by the title of their classes. Each character has his or her own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, the warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the wizard has the most powerful magic, the valkyrie has the best armor, and the Elf is the fastest in movement.[12] The characters are assigned by control panel in the four-player version, whereas in the two-player version each player selects their own character at the start of the game or while joining during the middle of play.
The enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers, and thieves. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no bosses in the game, the most dangerous enemy is Death, who can only be destroyed by using a magic potionâotherwise Death will vanish automatically after it has drained a certain amount of health from the player.[11]
As the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently.[11] While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, health also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies. The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game creditâinserting a coin in the arcadeâwithin a certain short time window after it died. This allows even the least proficient players to keep playing indefinitely, if they are willing to keep inserting coins. However, each player's final score will be divided by the amount of credits they used to play, resulting in an average.
Aside from the ability to have up to four players at once, the game is also noted for the narrator's voice, which is produced by a Texas Instruments TMS5220C speech chip.[7][11] The TMS5220C speech was encoded by Earl Vickers.[7] The narrator (voiced by Ernie Fosselius)[7] frequently makes statements repeating the game's rules, including: ""Shots do not hurt other players, yet"", ""Remember, don't shoot food"", ""Elf shot the food"", and ""Warrior needs food, badly"". The narrator occasionally comments on the battle by saying, ""I've not seen such bravery"" or ""Let's see you get out of here"". When a player's life force points fall below 200, the narrator states, ""Your life force is running out"", ""Elf needs food"", or ""Valkyrie is about to die"".
The control panel for the four-player cabinet is wider than other standard uprights in order to accommodate four people at the same time. Each player has an eight-way joystick and two buttons: one for ""fire"" (ranged attack) and one for ""magic"". The ""magic"" button also starts the game. After Gauntlet's release, other games started using this design, so it was a popular conversion target for newer games after it had its run.
"
Gauntlet Dark Legacy,,2002,Pocket Studios,Midway,,"In an ancient time, the evil mage Garm, using the power of the Runestones, released a great evil upon the land. This demon, Skorne, broke free of Garm's control, crushing him and imprisoning his soul in the underworld. Skorne then released his minions upon the land, and scattered the Runestones across the Eight Realms, so that they might never again be assembled and used against him.
No one has dared try ...

Until now.The manual included with the game elaborates on the story further, stating that Sumner is the good king of the eight realms and presides over them from his tower. The tower contained portals to all the realms for his easy access to them. It also stated that Garm, his younger brother, jealous of his power and status, searched for years for the 13 Runestones. Upon finding 12 after much toil of searching, he became impatient, and released Skorne then and there. Unfortunately, he was not able to control the demon without the 13th Runestone. Skorne summoned his minions and sent them through the portals in the tower to conquer the realms. Sumner, who was away at the time, returned to the tower, only to see the demon Skorne using it for his own evil gain. This infuriated Sumner, and he angrily engaged in battle with Skorne after sealing all the portals. Skorne was ""no match"" for Sumner's power, according to the manual, and he retreated into a deserted temple through Sumner's tower. Skorne shattered the enchanted stained glass window that was the only gateway to the temple, and gave one shard to each of his most powerful minions (the bosses of the game). He also scattered the 12 assembled Runestones across the various worlds. The temple from that point on is referred to as the Desecrated Temple.
The game is divided up into worlds, each containing a number of levels, all accessible from Sumner's tower.
The player's first objective is to beat all the levels, vanquishing the bosses of the eight originally available worlds. The player must collect crystals scattered about the levels to deactivate Sumner's protective shielding and gain access to new worlds and more levels.  Upon defeating the bosses, the stained-glass window is slowly restored, and the light pouring from it reveals a special portal in the tower. This portal takes the player to the 9th world, the Desecrated Temple. The player must fight through a single level packed with enemies. Upon exiting, the player is automatically transported to Skorne's chamber. Here the player has to defeat the demon Skorne. After his defeat, he retreats into the Underworld. The player must then collect 12 Runestones from the previous 8 worlds. Once that is accomplished, their power reveals another special portal in the tower, leading the player into the 10th world, the Underworld. There, after beating a single level, the player is automatically transported to the battle with True Skorne. The player defeats True Skorne, banishing him from the eight realms forever. But the war is not over. Garm absorbs the fading remnants of Skorne's power, becoming a huge, immensely powerful statue of Skorne. He forms an army and unleashes an assault upon Sumner's tower. The player's final goal is to beat the 11th and final world, the Battlegrounds. After beating the third level of this world and collecting the 13th Runestone that is hidden within it, the fourth and final special portal is revealed in the tower. This portal takes the player to Garm's Citadel, where the final battle of the game takes place.
","Gauntlet Dark Legacy, as an expansion to Gauntlet Legends, plays similarly, but with new levels, items, characters, and combat capabilities. The player has the option of performing a slow, strong attack, or a quick, weaker attack, as opposed to Legends, where there is only one type of attack. In Gauntlet Dark Legacy, the player can perform combos by using slow attacks and quick attacks in sequence while engaged in melee combat. Combos are much stronger than normal attacks, and are usually capable of taking out several enemies at once. As in Legends, each player has a turbo gauge that refills slowly and automatically. This turbo gauge allows the player to use turbo attacks, which do damage in a wide area or over a long distance, and can pierce through multiple enemies and walls. When the turbo gauge is empty, no turbo attacks can be used until it filled up again. Dark Legacy adds the ability for two players standing adjacent to each other to perform a combination turbo attack together, usually packing a lot of force (and draining half of the turbo gauge of the player that initiated the combination turbo).
The player can gather items from within levels or purchase them in the shop. Items are activated upon pickup, but can be disabled using the item menu. Items provide benefits and disappear within a set time or set number of uses. Dark Legacy has more items than the original, though are generally more expensive. This places more emphasis on the decision of which items to buy.
In Dark Legacy, the player has the added abilities of blocking, charging, and strafing. Strafing allows the player to constantly face one direction and fire medium-speed attacks. Blocking causes the player's character to stand still in a defensive position for a second or two. Any attacks made against the player are negated or do significantly less damage. When charging, players run forward with their weapons functioning like a lance while simultaneously blocking. Players can kill the enemies ahead of them while blocking their attacks. However, charging does consume a bit of the turbo gauge each time it is used.
The gameplay has roots in the original Gauntlet games. Most levels involve simply running along a designated path, destroying enemies before they can kill the player. Like in Gauntlet and Gauntlet II, enemies spawn from generators. Only when the generator is destroyed will the enemies stop spawning. Some generators will take multiple hits to destroy; as the generator is weakened, it will spawn less powerful enemies, until it is destroyed completely. There are some levels that have a maze-like aspect and are harder to navigate. Generally, levels have the path to the end easily in sight, with separate side paths that are harder to access. These side paths usually lead to important items, such as treasure, legendary weapons (which are used to weaken bosses), or runestones (which are required to progress through the game). Some levels will have a short movie before the level loads, serving to introduce the player to new types of enemies, or alerting the player that a legendary weapon is hidden somewhere in the level. Runestones are not hinted at in movies, though if a level that has a runestone is exited without the runestone being found, an evil laugh sound is played. Food still recovers health in Dark Legacy as it did in Gauntlet II, with each type of food restoring a different amount of health. Treasure is a rarity in Dark Legacy, as it is used to purchase items in the shop. This is a difference from the earlier Gauntlet games, where treasure was plentiful, giving extra points, but not serving any other purpose.

Gegege no Kitarou: Kiki Ippatsu! Youkai Rettou,,2003,,Konami,JP,"GeGeGe no KitarÅ focuses on the young KitarÅâthe last survivor of the Ghost Tribeâand his adventures with other ghouls and strange creatures of Japanese mythology. Along with: the remains of his father, Medama-Oyaji (a mummified Ghost tribesman reincarnated to inhabit his old eyeball); Nezumi-Otoko (the rat-man); Neko-Musume (the cat-girl) and a host of other folkloric creatures, KitarÅ strives to unite the worlds of humans and YÅkai.
Many storylines involve KitarÅ facing off with myriad monsters from other countries, such as the Chinese vampire Yasha, the Transylvanian Dracula IV, and other such non-Japanese creations. In addition to this, KitarÅ also locks horns with various malevolent YÅkai who threaten the balance between the Japanese creatures and humans.[9]
Some storylines make overt reference to traditional Japanese tales, most notably the folk tale of MomotarÅ, in which the young hero defends a Japanese territory from demons with the help of the native animals. The KitarÅ series The Great YÅkai War (Japanese: å¦æªå¤§æ¦äº, hepburn YÅkai DaisensÅ) draws a great deal of influence from this story, with KitarÅ and his YÅkai friends driving a group of Western ghouls away from an island.[10][11]
While the character of KitarÅ in GeGeGe no KitarÅ is a friendly boy who genuinely wants the best outcome for humans and YÅkai alike, his earlier incarnation in KitarÅ of the Graveyard portrays him as a much more darkly mischievous character. His apparent lack of empathy for humans combined with his general greed and desire for material wealth drives him to act in an unbecoming manner towards the human charactersâoften deceptively leading them into nightmarish situations or even to hell itself.[12]

For a fee, they will recover any lost or stolen item for a client with ""an almost 100% success rate"". The GetBackers' job often leads them into bizarre and dangerous situations in order to ""get back what shouldn't be gone"". Their targets range from lost video games to misplaced components of an atomic bomb.

A conglomeration of disused, condemned buildings clustered together to form a self-contained habitat, Limitless Fortress is subdivided into three specific tiers â Lower Town, the Beltline and Babylon City. Lower Town is the lowest in altitude, with several layers extending below ground level. The Beltline, the most dangerous area of The Limitless Fortress, is ruled by Der Kaiser, Ban's father. Babylon City, the upper most level of the Limitless Fortress, is said to be where the Brain Trust resides and is the home of Ginji's mother. In actuality, Babylon City is what one might consider the real world, with everything else being a virtual reality creation. Only those who have won the Ogre Battle may enter Babylon City and when that happens, they can change the world as they see fit.

The Voodoo King seeks to obtain three ""keys"" which will help him unlock the gates from Babylon City sealed by Ban's grandmother several years ago. After finding the three keys: Shido's chimera spirit, Himiko's mirror and the GetBackers, the Voodoo King is faced by Ginji, Thunder Emperor alter-ego attacks him in a clash which destroys the Voodoo King and making Raitei disappear forever as he existed to balance the scales. With Voodoo King gone, Raitei's purpose was fulfilled and he disappeared forever. Following this, both Ban and Ginji face each other in Ogre Battle with Ban giving up, impressed with Ginji's will.

Ghost Rider,,2006,,2K Games,"NA, PAL","Mephisto tells Vengeance to bring the Ghost Rider to him. Vengeance pursues Johnny on his own Hellcycle and captures him, opening a fiery portal to Hell in midair. In a fit of rage, Johnny becomes the Rider. Eventually, he reaches the Gates of Hell. However, Mephisto appears and prevents his escape. He explains to Johnny that he is losing his grip on his demons, which are escaping Hell and rampaging on the surface and, if not stopped, could trigger the apocalypse. If his army cannot be kept under control, the Angels of Heaven have threatened to subsume Mephisto's kingdom.
To prevent it, he recruits the Rider. Johnny dismisses him, though agrees when Mephisto sends Vengeance to kill Roxanne Simpsonâforcing Blaze to kill Vengeance. He travels back to Earth and proceeds to San Venganza to fight Lilith and the demon goddess' sons, along with the Dark Heart monsters, as well as the other demons who had escaped from Hell. Soon, he faces Lilith and kills her; with Johnny unaware that some of the demon goddess' sons, the Lilin, have survived and escaped with Blackheart's body. The Caretaker/Phantom Rider arrives, accompanied by the dhampir vampire-hunter Blade to help Ghost Rider. They tell the Rider that Blackout has joined forces with Deathwatch and his demons to steal military hardware. Johnny travels to and ultimately kills Blackout while Blade finds and hides Blackheart's body.
Caught off guard, Ghost Rider discovers that Roxanne has been kidnapped by Scarecrow. Having beaten him and saved Roxanne, Johnny is directed â by Scarecrow â to the carnival where his father was killed. There, he meets Mephisto, who reveals that he was against the Rider all along.
In order to summon a portal to Hell and usher in the Apocalypse (but knowing that any efforts using demons would have been thwarted by the Angels), Mephisto sent Ghost Rider on his quest so that the hellfire of his cycle would inscribe the massive geoglyph necessary to summon the portal. After the explanation, Blackheart, whose body was supposed to be hidden by Blade, manages to reawaken itself and escape to find Ghost Rider's and Mephisto's whereabouts. He immediately grows immensely powerfulâthough is taken down by Johnny. After which, Mephisto then disappears with Blackheart's body and Johnny reunites with Roxanne.
","The game features a system reminiscent to that of God of War and Devil May Cry, even having some of the same controls and style of attacks.[2] Combos are done with bare hands and with the Demonic chain. The overall mood, setting and visual style are very much the same as those in the first installment of Devil May Cry. When on the Hellcycle, Ghost Rider is still capable of performing some of the same chain attacks, and can shoot hellfire.
The Game Boy Advance version has some elements of Road Rash and Castlevania.
After beating the game on certain difficulty levels, bonus character skins can be unlocked. They include Classic Ghost Rider, Ghost Rider 2099, Vengeance, and Blade the vampire hunter.
If the player chooses to start the game again as Blade, they get slightly changed gameplay. Blade only has his Daywalker Sword for a weapon, he does not have the shotgun or chain-link attacks of Ghost Rider. Combo attacks are much more limited. He also does not replenish health by absorbing flames from the occasional fire-drums scattered throughout the game levels. Instead, Blade can suck the life force from any wounded foe that is a non-boss (readiness is indicated by a circle above their heads). However, during the motorcycle-racing sections, his vehicle can still shoot firebolts, and he can use his sword for melee combat.
The PSP version has an exclusive racing circuit gameplay, which includes not just Ghost Rider and the alternate characters who are playable in storyline, but also Ghost Rider's human form Johnny Blaze, Caretaker, Lilith and Deathwatch. In this gameplay, the racer can use a power icon, which allows them to utilizes their boost, traps and alternate projectiles, similar to Nintendo's Mario Kart series. The racing circuit stage includes Daily Bugle from Spider-Man trilogy franchise.

Adventure on Soccer Island utilizes the football skills of its real-life protagonist, David Beckham, as game mechanics. David Beckham must use his soccer ball in order to defeat enemies, collect items and progress through levels. Beckham normally dribbles the soccer ball, but the player can kick the ball in any direction to collect items and defeat enemies.[3] Beckham can level up certain attributes after performing them enough; for example, his kicking skill can level up after he has kicked the ball enough.[3]
The plot of the game centres around Mister Woe, who has invaded Soccer Island; Mister Woe has taken all ""precious things"", and turned all the animals of the island into monsters. It is up to David Beckham to save the island.[1]

Golden Sun|Ougon no Taiyou: Hirakareshi FuuinJP,Yes,2001,Camelot Software Planning,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","Three years prior to the start of the game's main story, Saturos and Menardi raid Mt. Aleph with the intent to steal the Elemental Stars, but fail to solve the riddles guarding them and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.[14]
Three years later, Isaac, Garet, and Jenna join Kraden on his research trip to Mt. Aleph and manage to solve the shrine's puzzles and retrieve the Elemental Stars.[15] They are ambushed by Saturos and Menardi, along with Felix, a previous resident of Vale who was kidnapped during the storms three years earlier. They kidnap Jenna and Kraden and take three of the four Elemental Stars and depart to light the four lighthouses and release Alchemy on the world. Isaac's party is joined by two other young adepts named Ivan and Mia,[16][17] and together they pursue Saturos' party in a lengthy chase and journey that spans two continents, climaxing in a fierce battle that leads to Saturos and Menardi's death.[18][19]
With Saturos and Menardi dead, Felix convinces Jenna and Kraden to join him on a quest to complete Saturos' original objective to activate the two remaining lighthouses that he failed to light. Joined by new companions Sheba and Piers, Felix and his party embark on an epic expedition while pursued by Isaac's party.[20] Eventually, Felix's party is able to achieve entrance into a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean.[21] When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature: it is the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss.[22] Armed with this new information, Felix manages to persuade Isaac and his party to join them, and together they fulfill the goal of releasing Alchemy and preventing Weyard's eventual decay.[23]
Thirty years after Isaac and his party of adepts return the power of Alchemy to Weyard, continents have shifted, new countries have emerged, and new species have appeared. However, Psynergy Vortexes, which suck the elemental Psynergy from both the land and the power-wielding Adepts, are appearing all over Weyard. The original games' heroes' descendants â Matthew, Karis, Rief, and Tyrell â set out to solve the mystery of the vortexes, and face a world adapting to the constant presence of psynergy.
The game begins with Tyrell accidentally crashing one of Ivan's inventions, a Soarwing, so Isaac sends him out with Matthew and Karis to retrieve a feather of the mountain roc to build a new one.[24] After meeting up with Kraden, Rief, and Nowell, they are ambushed by villains Blados, Chalis, and Arcanus and the party is separated.[25][26] As Matthew's party travels across Weyard to reunite with Kraden and Nowell, they encounter a deadly eclipse heralded by the lighting of Luna Tower, causing suffering and destruction across the world. They manage to activate an ancient machine known as the Apollo's Lens to end the eclipse, and return home to discover a large Psynergy Vortex sitting ominously near their home.[27]

Golden Sun: The Lost Age|Ougon no Taiyou: Ushinawareshi TokiJP,,2003,Camelot Software Planning,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The Lost Age presents a similar traditional role-playing video game formula that its first half pioneered. Players guide a cast of characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, interact with other characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and take part in a building, predefined narrative. While many actions the player takes are compulsory and central to the story, The Lost Age allows the player to complete many objectives in the order of their choice; visiting previous locations to advance story elements and complete gameplay objectives are given a stronger emphasis than in the previous game.[2]
Much of the time spent outside of battle takes place either in the game's overworld or within dungeons, caves, and other locales with puzzles integrated into their layout. Unlike the original game, in which the overworld was explored on foot except for a brief, non-navigable boat ride, a large portion of The Lost Age's gameplay involves navigating a magical ship across a large sea, visiting continents and islands.[3] To complete puzzles, players must either push pillars to construct negotiable paths between elevated areas, climb up or descend cliffs, or obtain a special item to progress through the story and game world. Many of these puzzles revolve heavily around the usage of the game's resident form of magic spells, Psynergy, requiring the player to find items that grant the bearer new forms of Psynergy in order to accomplish tasks. Acquiring new Psynergy spells gives players access to new locations and secrets hidden within the game world.[4][5]
Whereas many role-playing video games limit the usage of their forms of magic to battles as offensive and defensive measures, Psynergy spells are also heavily used in puzzles and exploration.[4] Some types of Psynergy can only be used in combat; conversely, some spells are only used in the game's overworld and in non-battle scenarios.[4] Still other Psynergy can be used for both situations; for example, the âFrostâ spell can be used to damage enemies in battle, or to transform puddles of water into elongated pillars of ice as part of a puzzle. The player gains more and more Psynergy spells as the game progresses, either through levelling up or acquiring and equipping, or using, special items, and with each ""utility"" Psynergy spell the party gains access to more locations and secrets hidden within the game world. Players will be required to return to previous locations in the game to finish off puzzles which they could not solve earlier because of the lack of specific Psynergy spells.[6]
The Lost Age contains both random monster encounters and compulsory battles that advance the story.[2] When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought up where the enemy party is on the opposing side and the player's party is on the battling side. While a battle being is conducted, the characters and background swirl around and change positions in a pseudo-3D effect.
Gameplay in relation to The Lost Age's battle mode is similar to traditional role-playing video games. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping their own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense.[7] If all the player's characters are downed by reducing their hit points to zero, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a monetary penalty.[7] The successful completion of a battle yields experience points, coins, and occasionally rare items.[8] In addition to the main game itself, there is also a competitive battling mode accessible from the menu screen, where players can enter their teams into an arena to battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies or other players head-to-head.[9]
One of the most important features in the Golden Sun series is the collection and manipulation of elemental creatures called Djinn (singular: Djinni), and The Lost Age introduces a host of new Djinn. They can be found scattered in hiding throughout the game. There are eleven Djinn for each of the four elements (not counting the ones that can only be found in the original Golden Sun) that may be allocated to each character.  Djinn form the basis of the game's statistics enhancement system, and the way they are allocated to different characters modifies the characters' classes, increasing maximum hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, and also alters the available Psynergy that the characters can perform.[10] Djinni may also be used to directly attack an opponent, and once used, Djinn no longer contribute to a character's class but can be used to summon a powerful elemental spirit to attack an opponent.[11] This is the game's most powerful method of attack, and also the riskiest, as it requires Djinn to be on standby and therefore not available to bolster the statistics of whichever character the Djinni is equipped to.  Once a Djinni on Standby has been used for a Summon Sequence, it takes a number of turns recovering before it restores itself to Set position on a character, but a subsequent increase in the affinity of the element of the attack is bolstered on the character for the duration of the battle.[11][12]

The player takes control of the Vic Viper spacecraft tasked with destroying hordes of enemies. Various traditional elements of Gradius are present â the moai, an undefended final boss, and the upgrade power meter. The weapons system remained mostly unchanged as the configurations available are identical to Gradius III, with the exception that the edit mode is missing. There are four different types of weapons configurations: Balanced, (traditional Gradius) wide area (Salamander) power, and air-to-ground. Each configuration is indicated by the color of Vic Viper. Unlike Gradius III, there are only two shield options â shield and force field. In addition, the S. option (""snake option"") is not present in this version; the player can however choose to have the computer assign weapon power-ups automatically or purchase upgrades manually.
The game's configuration allows the player to choose between three difficulty modes, with each mode consisting of three loops â progressively more difficult play-throughs that are unlocked as previous loops are cleared. The Japanese version further included a challenge game play mode that had to be unlocked by achieving a high score during a single play-through of the game's normal difficulty mode. Additional challenges could then by unlocked by completing other challenges. The challenge mode was absent from the U.S. and European releases due to the game being released in Japan several months later.

Grand Theft Auto Advance,No,2004,Digital Eclipse,Rockstar Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Grand Theft Auto Advance is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a top-down perspective. The game had to be adapted to the Game Boy Advance's hardware limitations. As a result, it does not have animated cutscenes, nor does it have Grand Theft Auto III's much-lauded pedestrian dialogue. All cutscenes are text-only with hand-drawn pictures of the characters' faces, with a thematic backdrop behind. The art style is consistent with that used for the cover and loading art of the three-dimensional releases in the series. Replacing the pedestrian dialogue, some soundbites taken from Grand Theft Auto III are played when the player hits someone's car. Short police radio voiceovers will announce the player's location and vehicle type when the player commits a crime.
The game does not feature radio channels. Like the Game Boy Color ports of Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2, each car has one fixed tune that is constantly repeated and cannot be changed. These include parts of some familiar Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto 2 and Grand Theft Auto III tunes, in instrumental versions. Despite this, billboards for the radio stations featured in Grand Theft Auto III can be seen throughout Liberty City.[2]

In the store, Randall encounters a small, furry creature called a mogwai (Cantonese: é­æª, ""devil""). The owner, Mr. Wing, refuses to sell the creature to Randall. However, his grandson secretly sells the mogwai to Randall, warning him to remember three important rules that must never be broken: do not expose the mogwai to light, especially sunlight, which will kill it, do not let it come in contact with water, and above all, never feed it after midnight.
Randall returns home to Kingston Falls where he gives the mogwai to Billy as a pet. Billy works in the local bank, where he fears his dog Barney will be put down by the elderly miser Mrs. Deagle. Randall names the mogwai ""Gizmo"", explains the three rules he was told, and Billy makes sure to treat him well. When Billy's young friend Pete accidentally spills water over Gizmo, five more mogwai spawn from his back, a more troublemaking sort led by the aggressive Stripe, named after the tuft of fur on his head. Billy shows one of the mogwai to his former science teacher, Mr. Hanson, spawning another mogwai, on whom Hanson experiments. Back at home, Stripe and his fellow mogwai trick Billy into feeding them after midnight by severing the power cord to his bedside clock. They form cocoons, as does Hanson's mogwai. Shortly after, the cocoons hatch and they emerge as mischievous, reptilian monsters referred to as 'gremlins', who then torture Gizmo and attack Billy's mother, Lynn, while Hanson is killed by his gremlin.
Lynn and Billy are able to kill off the gremlins attacking Lynn, except for Stripe, who escapes to a local YMCA. Billy pursues him but Stripe manages to jump into a swimming pool, spawning a new army of gremlins who wreak chaos around Kingston Falls. Many people are injured or outright killed by the gremlins' rampage, including Mrs. Deagle. 
As Billy rescues his girlfriend, Kate Beringer, they hide in the now-abandoned bank where Kate reveals to Billy and Gizmo the reason she hates Christmas. When she was nine years old, her father went missing on Christmas Eve and did not return on Christmas Day. Several days later, he was found dead in their chimney while dressed as Santa Claus. He was planning a surprise for Kate and her mother but had slipped and broken his neck while climbing down the chimney. 
Billy and Kate discover the town has fallen silent and the gremlins are watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in the local theater. They set off an explosion, killing all the gremlins except Stripe, who left the theater to get more candy at a Montgomery Ward store across the street. As morning approaches, Billy chases Stripe into the store, where Stripe attempts to use a water fountain to spawn more gremlins. Gizmo opens a skylight, exposing Stripe to sunlight, killing him.
In the aftermath of the rampage, Mr. Wing arrives to take Gizmo back. He scolds the Peltzers for their carelessness, and states that Western society is not ready for the responsibility of caring for mogwai, but comments that Billy might some day be ready to care for Gizmo properly. Gizmo likewise believes so, having become attached to Billy, and bids him goodbye just before Mr. Wing departs with him.

The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy,,2006,Full Fat,Midway Games,,NaN,"The gameplay heavily mirrors that of the Power Stone series and  Shrek SuperSlam. In the game, up to four players battle in a three dimensional arena and perform light and heavy style attacks in an attempt to deplete their opponents' health and knock them out.   Each stage contains elements that can affect the battle, such as enemies that will attack the players or traps that can be triggered. Most levels include multiple sub-arenas and will transition from one to the next after a short amount of time has passed, such as rising lava levels in an Underworld cavern forcing players to ride a giant snake to escape. Players can find and equip different weapons scattered throughout the arenas, such as a halberd or a club, to do additional damage. Treasure chests contain items including weapons, healing items, and Mojo Balls that restore the player's Mojo Meter. When the Mojo Meter fills once, a Mojo Smackdown can be performed where the character attacks an opponent with a barrage of attacks that will instantly knock them out. When the Mojo Meter fills twice, a Mojo Meltdown can be performed, instantly knocking out all opponents. An opponent is not fully defeated until their lives are depleted and the player or another opponent attacks them, triggering a ""finishing blow"" sequence.
Several gameplay modes are available. In Story Mode, players must complete five battles against a series of computer-controlled opponents before culminating in a final battle with the brain-eating meteor from the episode ""Little Rock of Horrors"". Story Mode supports both single player and cooperative two-player play. Vs. Mode allows up to four players to battle against one another, with the option to further customize the game's rules. Mission Mode tasks players with completing specific objectives using predetermined characters in set scenarios. Additional characters, stages, costumes, and rule sets can be unlocked by completing missions, finishing Story Mode with each character, and fulfilling other objectives.
The Wii version of the game incorporates some motion controls by allowing the player to swing the Wii Remote to perform heavy attacks, as well as using its infrared pointer to point at a series of onscreen targets to execute finishing moves.  It also supports two control schemes: one involving the Wii Remote and Nunchuk that utilizes the said motion controls, and another that utilizes the GameCube controller.

Groove Adventure Rave: Hikari to Yami no Daikessen,,2002,KCEJ,Konami,JP,"In 0015, the world is corrupted by Dark Bring, dark stones that bestow powerful magic with different abilities to their owners. The Dark Brings are used by the Raregroove Kingdom, and the Symphonia Kingdom fight against them with their five powerful Rave stones. Shiba Roses, the Rave Master, attempts to destroy Sinclaire, the ""mother"" of all of the Dark Brings, with the Ten Commandments sword. However, the aftermath causes a massive explosion known as Overdrive, destroying one-tenth of the known world. Shiba, protected from the disaster by his special guardian ""dog"" Plue, holds onto the Rave required to power his sword. Plue and the four remaining Raves, however, get scattered around the world.
Fifty years later, sixteen-year-old Haru Glory lives on the peaceful Garage Island with his older sister, Cattleya. Shortly after Haru accidentally fishes Plue up, Shiba arrives wishing to reclaim Plue, but a group of terrorists from the Demon Card organization appear to kill Shiba. Shiba tells Haru that he is the second Rave Master, entrusting the Ten Commandments, Plue, and his Rave to him. Seeking power to defeat Demon Card, Haru and Plue set off on a journey to find the missing Rave stones. Upon arriving at the mainland, Haru befriends a girl named Elie, who has no recollection of her past. During their journey, Haru encounters enemies from Demon Card who eventually become his allies, including Shuda and Sieg Hart. Haru later meets a diverse group of allies, including Hamrio Musica, grandson of a blacksmith; Let Dahaka and Julia, two who appear human but are in fact of the Dragon Race; Griffon Kato, a strange blue creature and Plue's friend; Ruby, a penguin and a casino owner; Belnika, a mage; and Niebel, Sieg's close friend. He also encounters Gale ""King"" Raregroove, the king of the Raregroove Kingdom and leader of Demon Card. On the Tower of Din, Haru reunites with his absent father Gale Glory to defeat King and end Demon Card. Although they win, Gale sacrifices himself to save his son from Din's destruction.
Some time later, King's son, Lucia, appears and revives Demon Card. He wishes to capture Elie to use the magical energy known as Etherion hidden within her body. While facing Lucia and his forces, Haru's group also learn of the mythical creature known as Endless, which threatens mankind by provoking another Overdrive and can only be destroyed with Etherion. Using all Sinclaires, Lucia absorbs Endless. Lucia's objective is to destroy the world, which is actually a parallel dimension created by his ancestor with Etherion after the original was ruined by a plague and his family was cursed as a result. After Haru finds all of the Raves, Elie uses Etherion to combine them. In order to avoid another Overdrive, Haru and his friends oppose Lucia and his strongest enemies in the Star Memory. Although Haru defeats Lucia, he is absorbed by Endless and convinces Elie to destroy it even if it means taking his life. One year later, Elie has lost her memories of Haru, and she and the others visit his grave. Haru appears alive thanks to the Star Memory's magic and reunites with Elie, who then remembers him. The warriors go their separate ways, and Haru and Elie return to Garage Island to live together.

GT Advance Championship RacingAdvance GTAJP,,"20010320010321March 21, 2001Â (JP)June 8, 2001Â (US)June 15, 2001Â (EU)",MTO,THQ,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"GT Advance Championship Racing is a customizable experience, including 48 cars from 8 car manufacturers, and 32 courses.[5][7] Some of the cars featured in the game are exclusively found in Asia, such as the Nissan Cube.[5] The courses vary between paved and dirt roads, requiring the player to adapt their driving to meet the conditions of the course they're driving on.[5]
The game's championship mode features four levels of play, three cups of varying levels, and an unlockable ""kart racing mode"".[7] Upgrades earned through gameplay can be added to the player's car,[5] and in some cases, they can change the physical appearance of the vehicle.[7] The game contains multiplayer support, allowing two people to play against each other using a Game Link Cable.
Controls are simple, with the A and B buttons controlling the player's gas and brakes respectively. The R and L buttons shift the car up or down a gear in manual control, and the D-Pad controls the car's steering.[7] The game requires the player to master the powerslide technique to skid around corners and to reduce their lap time.[5]
The roads in the game are painted on a flat plane, which allows the game to progress at a smooth rate, but makes it harder for the player to see upcoming turns in the road. The problem can be remedied by playing through a track multiple times to gain familiarity with the turns in a course.[7] The cars are rendered through sprite frames, giving the impression of 3D graphics in the game.[7]
The Japanese version of the game, Advance GTA, had save support. However, THQ pulled the battery RAM out of the North American and European releases of the game, and utilized passwords to save data instead.[1][5][7] The system forces players of the North American and European releases to enter a sixteen digit code consisting of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols into the game to retrieve their data.[7] Many critics blamed THQ for what was perceived to be a cost-cutting measure.[5][7][9] It was the only major change from the Japanese version of the game.[1]

GT Advance 2: Rally RacingAdvance RallyJP,,2002,MTO,THQ,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"GT Advance 2: Rally Racing is a racing game and the cars and environments hold true to a rally racing format.[1] The game contains fifteen cars from Japanese companies such as Subaru, Suzuki, and Mitsubishi. Upgrades are not available for the cars, but it is possible to fine-tune them to fit personal preference.[1]
The game has several different modes. The main part of the game, ""world rally"", moves the player through fourteen courses found in various locations in the world.[1] The game also has a head-to-head mode against a friend with a system link, 15 different license tests that familiarize the player with the controls of the game, a time trial mode, a single race mode, a practice mode, and a navigator mode, in which the player directs the driver of the car through button and d-pad presses instead of driving themselves.[1]
The game includes a major enhancement in the save system from the previous installment. In GT Advance Championship Racing, as a cost-saving measure, the battery RAM was pulled from the game and was replaced with a password system instead of the one included in the Japanese version of the game. Critics cited this as the chief problem with the North American release of the game.[2][3] GT Advance 2: Rally Racing addressed the problem by putting the normal save system back in, yet making this game a little less favorable than its predecessor.

Guilty Gear X: Advance Edition,,2002,Arc System Works,Sammy Studios,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The fight system has a four-main-attack-button configuration: punch, kick, slash and heavy slash.[3][4][note 2] Players may also launch taunt attacks,[4] with their main objective to reduce the opponent's health to zero in a predetermined time.[6] To win a fight a player must accumulate two points, with each round won earning a point.[6] Guilty Gear X has features common in fighting games: combos, aerial attacks and counterattacks.[7][8][9] A new feature is the Roman Cancel, which allows a player to cancel their move and its aftereffects to make other attacks.[7][10]
The game has a tension gauge, increasing when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is stopped for a long time.[11] When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage than regular moves.[7][10] A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health;[7][12][note 3] if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge for the remainder of that round.[12]
Guilty Gear X's Dreamcast version includes four modes of play:[3] Arcade, the game's primary narrative mode;[5] Survival, in which the player fights through infinite levels until they are defeated;[10][14][15] Training, which allows a player to practice moves with the help of an in-game move list[10][16] and Versus, in which a player can fight another player.[3] Guilty Gear X Plus also has art-gallery and story modes;[17] according to the Sega website, the latter explains ""misteries"" which the Dreamcast version does not.[16] The Advance Edition includes tag-team and three-on-three modes; each player chooses two or three characters, respectively, and can switch characters during a fight.[18]

Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting,,2002,Treasure Co. Ltd,ESP Software,JP,"Ippo Makunouchi was an extremely shy high school student, unable to make friends due to always being busy helping his mother run their family fishing charter business. Because he kept to himself, a group of bullies led by Umezawa got into the habit of picking on him. One day, when these bullies gave him a rather serious beating, a middleweight professional boxer who was passing by stopped them and took the injured Ippo to the Kamogawa Gym (é´¨å·ãã¯ã·ã³ã°ã¸ã , Kamogawa Bokushingu Jimu), owned by retired boxer Genji Kamogawa, to treat his wounds. After Ippo awoke to the sounds of boxers training, the boxer who saved him, Mamoru Takamura, tried to cheer Ippo up by letting him vent his frustrations on a sandbag. It was then that they had their first glimpse into Ippo's talent for boxing. After that incident, Ippo gave the situation a lot of thought and decided that he would like to begin a career as a professional boxer. When he conveys this message to Mamoru Takamura, he gets verbally reprimanded: Takamura thought Ippo was taking professional boxing too lightly. However, Takamura felt that he couldn't outright refuse Ippo, especially since his feat of punching the sandbag much harder than anybody else in the gym (except for Takamura). Therefore, he challenges Ippo to catch 10 falling leaves from a tree simultaneously after a week of training, fully convinced that Ippo would fail, Takamura jogs away as he continues his roadwork.
However, after a week of tough training, involving nightly hours, Ippo manages the technique in the nick of time. He waits for the jogging Takamura to come by his usual path and surprises him by catching all 10 of the falling leaves and only doing so with his left hand. This impresses Takamura greatly, and he informs Ippo that the action required to catch all 10 leaves is called a boxing jab. Takamura invites Ippo back to the boxing gym for introductions.
When they got back to the gym, the coach, Genji Kamogawa, was not at all impressed by Makunouchi's lack of fighting spirit, and therefore, was challenged by Takamura to have a practice spar against a member of the gym. However, Kamogawa decides to give Ippo a severe challenge and tells him to spar with Miyata, who is 16, the same age as Ippo. Miyata is known as a boxing prodigy and is one of Kamogawa gym's future hopes. Takamura gets extremely worried with this prospect, as Miyata skill is way above the four-rounder pro boxer. As expected, Ippo loses by KO, but not until Miyata struggles dodging his punches and finally ends the match with his trump card: ""The Counter"". Coach Kamogawa decides that he has great fighting sense and spirit and decides to train him to eventually become the Japanese champion with a world ranking while Miyata became the OPBF (Oriental Pacific Boxing Federation) Champion. Both are expected to hit high in the rankings and, eventually, fight each other for the world champion's belt.
The story focuses heavily on character developmentâeven during the matches something is learned about both fighters. Ippo has a habit of running into his opponents before matches, giving him a chance to learn more about their backgrounds and even sympathize with them. Ippo is an extremely timid and modest person who never assumes that he is strong enough. He instead draws courage from seeing the strength of his opponent and realizing that he is able to stand up to it. Ippo and his friendly rivalry with Miyata is the main draw in the early part of the series. That later changes to Ippo's path toward the Japanese Featherweight Championship and eventually the world championship. Along the way the audience is given glimpses into the other characters' pasts, motivations, relationships to others, and current boxing trials. A colorful cast of supporting characters and opponents as well as side stories concerning their paths in the boxing world rounds out the series.

Hamepane Tokyo Mew Mew,,2002,WinkySoft,Takara,JP,"In Tokyo, Japan, a young girl named Ichigo Momomiya attends an endangered species exhibit with her ""crush"" Masaya Aoyama. After an earthquake, Ichigo and four other girls are bathed in a strange light. A cat appears before Ichigo, then merges with her. The next day, she begins acting like a cat and making cat puns. After meeting RyÃ´ Shirogane and KeiichirÃ´ Akasaka, Ichigo learns that she was infused with the DNA of the Iriomote cat. Ryou and Keiichirou explain that this allows her to transform into Mew Ichigo, a powerful heroic cat girl. She is ordered to defeat Chimera Animasâalien parasites which infect animals and turn them into monsters. Ryou and Keiichirou instruct Ichigo to find the four other girls from the exhibitâthe remaining Mew Mews.
The first Mew Mew Ichigo encounters is Minto Aizawa, a spoiled, wealthy girl and ballerina who is infused with the genes of the blue lorikeet;[n 1] Retasu Midorikawa, a shy but smart girl who endures constant bullying from three girls and absorbs the genes of the finless porpoise; a hyper and yet young girl named Bu-Ling Huang who receives the genes of the golden lion tamarin; and Zakuro Fujiwara, a professional actress and model infused with the genes of the gray wolf.
The five Mew Mews battle the Chimera Animas and their alien controllers Quiche, Pie and Tart. Quiche falls in love with Ichigo where he tries to gain her love despite the fact that he is trying to eliminate the other Mew Mews. One of the Mew Mew gets attacked and dies from an alien bite, but then comes back to life. Pie and Tart later join Quiche in trying to destroy the Mew Mews.
As the fighting intensifies, the Mew Mews are tasked with finding ""Mew Aqua"", a material created from pure water that contains immense power for combating the alien attacks and can be sensed by the Mew Mews. During a battle with Quiche at an aquarium, Ichigo is in danger of losing when the mysterious Blue Knight appears and rescues her. He returns periodically throughout the series, protecting Ichigo from various dangers. It is later revealed that the Blue Knight is in fact Masaya. Shortly after this discovery, Masaya collapses and transforms again. This time, he transforms into Deep Blue, the alien leader who wants to destroy humanity. After explaining to Ichigo that Masaya was a false form for temporary use, Deep Blue attacks the Mew Mews. Pie and Tart try to stop the other mew mews while Ichigo goes after Deep Blue. He and Quiche battle and Deep Blue wins.
Masaya's personality briefly reappears and he uses the Mew Aqua inside Deep Blue to save Ichigo and Tokyo, killing himself in the process. Devastated over his loss, Ichigo pours her power into Masaya to save his life, losing her own in the process. Masaya kisses her, changing her back to a human and revives her. Ryou gives Pie the remaining Mew Aqua to save the aliens' world, after which Quiche, Pie, and Tart say their goodbyes and return to their own world.
In the two-volume sequel Tokyo Mew Mew Ã  La Mode, Ichigo and Masaya move to England to study endangered species. The remaining Mew Mews continue to eliminate the Chimera Animas left behind by the aliens. They face a new threat in the form of the Saint Rose Crusaders: Humans with special abilities who desire to conquer the world and create a utopia while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas. 
Berry Shirayuki becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo's place as the leader. Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two endangered species, the Andean mountain cat and the Amami rabbit. As one of the strongest Mew Mews, Berry is targeted by two of the Crusaders, who attack her at school. Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle. For their final attack, two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo and set them against the Mew Mews. Berry and her childhood friend Tasuku Meguro use their new-found feelings of love to reverse the hypnosis and cause a change of heart in the Crusaders.

A third quest, that supports those two, is to obtain all the ""Ham-Chats"".[2] Ham-Chats are words, but also much more than that. At the start of the game, Hamtaro accidentally causes almost all the Ham-Chats in his Ham-Ham Dictionary to vanish, starting the hunt to fill the dictionary. Each Ham-Chat represents both a word (for communicating) and an action and/or motion. For instance, Lookie means to look. It is one of the most common Ham-Chats in the game, and solely has an action function. In that sense, action Ham-Chats often come with the necessary item (which is part of the Ham-Chat motion and doesn't show up in the inventory) and therefore, go another way than other adventure games in which the player already has all the actions available, but still has to get the required items. The other kind of Ham-Chat can only be used in conversations. A Ham-Chat like Perksie (Listen) for instance, only has value for conversations. New Ham-Chats are necessary to gain access to new parts of a conversation and get another Ham-Ham to do or give something.
Apart from Ham-Chats, the player also is required to obtain items (like a more conventional adventure game), though most of them are merely needed to complete minigames/side-quest. They are divided in inventory items, songs, currency and gems. Inventory items function like they do in any other adventure game and need to be combined with the Ham-Chats in order to proceed.
As in its predecessor, Ham-Hams Unite, this game allows you to put together the actions for Ham-Chat words to create dances, with a room just for this purpose in the Clubhouse. In Ham-Ham Heartbreak, however, there is an additional feature relating to ""Ham-Jams.""
You can pick up a variety of items such as sunflower seeds on the ground by selecting hif-hif or digging for them with digdig. Rocks can also be found in this game, but they serve a different purpose in Heartbreak. You can take the rocks and polish them in the RubRub Room in order to uncover gems.

Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,,2003,Magic Pockets,EA Games,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"In this stage, the player competes for the Hogwarts Inter-House Quidditch Cup using one of the Hogwarts house teams â Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin. Each House team is represented by its Seeker, and each Seeker is a specific character from the books (Harry Potter for Gryffindor, Draco Malfoy for Slytherin, Cedric Diggory for Hufflepuff, and Cho Chang for Ravenclaw). When the player chooses a team, the Seeker of the chosen House flies off on his or her broomstick. If this is the player's first time playing a team, the character will give a short statement praising the player's selection, then the house challenges appear. These challenges focus on specific areas of a full Quidditch game and are used to learn the game for new players, or polish skills as a returning player.
There are six House challenges: Passing, Tackle and Shoot, Seeker, Beaters and Bludgers, Special Moves, and Combos. Each is led by a relevant player â for example, Harry leads the Gryffindor Seeker challenge, while Angelina Johnson leads the Gryffindor Passing challenge and Oliver Wood leads the Gryffindor Combo challenge. Only the first three challenges - Passing, Tackle and Shoot, and Seeker - are initially available to the player, with Beaters and Bludgers, and Special Moves unlocked after the first Quidditch match, and Combos unlocked after the second match. Completing the first set of challenges allows the player to play their first full Quidditch match. The team the player faces depends on what team they are playing as. Winning the game unlocks the next set of challenges which must then be completed to unlock the next match. Winning the second game unlocks the final challenge. Completing that challenge unlocks the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup final match.
During a Quidditch match, the player controls the Chasers who try and score goals with the Quaffle to earn 10 points per goal. The Chasers' abilities depend on which challenges have been completed (for a first time player) (Example: in the player's first game, he will be unable to perform special moves or combo moves). Abilities also unlock by collecting certain Quidditch cards. These cards are earned by doing certain tasks, such as winning without conceding a goal or performing a certain number of steals in a game. Along the top of the screen, each team's score display also features a thin bar with one half of the Golden Snitch. Actions performed in game by the Chasers such as any successful pass increase the bar slightly, and performing a successful string of combo passes and shots can increase the bar by an amount proportional to the length of the combo string, up to seven actions. The player can continue to chain actions to the combo but the counter will not go past 7. The bar will increase until both halves join.
The Chasers can also perform moves to drain the opposing team's bar such as successfully hitting the opposing chasers with a Bludger, performing a successful Special Move tackle, or performing a Team Special Move (which is unblockable). Every team in the game has a unique Team Special Move that triggers a short cinematic of spectacular teamwork between the team Chasers (and sometimes Beaters) and has a possibility of scoring multiple goals. For example, The Ravenclaw Team Special Move, the Burdish of Raven, scores three times for 30 points total â something no other Team Special Move, even those of the national teams, does. Although the original Quidditch rule disallows having more than 2 chasers in the scoring area at the same time (known as Stooging, as stated in Quidditch Through the Ages), doing such behaviour in this game will not result in penalty.
Once both halves of the Snitch join, the game moves into the Snitch Chase, regardless of score (it is possible, though unlikely, to engage in the Snitch Chase with the score at 0-0). During the Snitch Chase, the player now controls the Seeker and follows the Snitch, in a race against the opposing seeker to catch it. The player can use a speed boost which drains a boost bar directly proportional to the size of the snitch bar accumulated during the Chaser portion of the game. If a player doesn't have a boost bar of maximum size, staying in the Snitch's slipstream (which normally refills the bar) with his bar filled will increase its size. Using the boost, once the player is close enough, he can try to grab the Snitch. If he is successful, he earns 150 points for his team and the match ends. This typically wins the match but is not always the case (example, if the player's team is trailing by 160 points, catching the snitch would end the match but the player would still lose). The Cup is based on points, not wins, so high scoring teams have a better chance at winning, and the team with the highest point total after all three games have been played wins the Cup. Winning the Cup with any team unlocks the Quidditch World Cup.
Exhibition allows the player to play a one-off match between the Hogwarts house teams at Hogwarts during summer or winter. The player can also choose to play an international match, controlling a country team of their choosing. Only the venues of the England and United States teams are available to players initially, but as players win against international teams in an 'away' game in the international tournament, more venues are unlocked. This mode also offers the game's multiplayer option. The team that the second player can choose depends on the team pool that the first player selects. In either single or multiplayer, a Hogwarts team cannot play against a world cup team or on any international field, and no world cup team can play at Hogwarts.
The World Cup stage is similar to the Hogwarts stage in terms of game play, with the exception that there are no challenges available to the player and the teams are the national teams of real countries instead of Hogwarts houses. Several different team choices are available to the player including England, the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Australia, the Nordic Team, Spain, and Bulgaria. The latter of which features the 'star seeker' from the book series, Viktor Krum. However, Bulgaria is unavailable to the player until they collect enough Quidditch cards.
The key difference between the World Cup and the Hogwarts cup is that after team selection, the player must choose what model of broom he will use, which is essentially a Difficulty selection screen. The four models available are Comet 260 (Easy), Nimbus 2000 (Medium), Nimbus 2001 (Hard) and Firebolt (Very Hard). Only the Comet 260 and Nimbus 2000 are available in the beginning, the others being unlocked with Quidditch cards. The different brooms offer different handling in-game, although this is hardly noticeable. The broom selection more directly affects how hard the AI will play.
The player will play against every team in the World Cup twice, once at their home stadium and once at the opposing team's home ground. The Cup is awarded the same way as the Hogwarts Cup, so the team with the highest score total at the end of the season wins the World Cup. The player can play multiple separate World Cups with different teams simultaneously, but can only run one World Cup with any given team. For example, the player can play a World Cup as England and a separate World Cup as France at the same time, but cannot play two separate World Cups as France at the same time.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter to Himitsu no HeyaJP,,2002,Eurocom,EA Games,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The game's core gameplay is straightforward. Taking control of Harry, the player explores Hogwarts castle and grounds. Throughout the course of the game, the player will encounter events that tie into the storyline of the second book.[1] Filling the gaps between these events are various classes, where the player will learn how to fly a broomstick and learn new spells for combating bosses, among other things. Each new spell is accompanied by a challenge, which the player must get through in a certain amount of time to complete that class period. During the later parts of the game, the player will face challenges which are not time-limited and are not related to learning spells. These challenges are all based on events from the book, for example, travelling into the Forbidden Forest and gathering ingredients for a potion Hermione is making.[2]

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Yes,2005,Magic Pockets,EA Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game follows the events and characters of novel, and film, with the player controlling Harry Potter (voiced by Daniel Larner), Hermione Granger (Harper Marshall), and Ron Weasley (Gregg Chillin). The game uses an improved version of the group casting mechanic found in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.[1] Improved graphics mean the characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. Gameplay in the Goblet of Fire is much more action-orientated, which is a change from the puzzle and adventure elements found in previous games of the series.[1]
The game is split up into particular levels, rather than freeroaming around Hogwarts castle like in earlier games. Levels are played from parts of the novel the game is based on, with levels ranging from the Quidditch World cup, the Prefect's bathroom, and the Herbology greenhouses; which can be entered from the in-game ""pensieve"".[1] The game also features modes outside of combat, including broomstick flying, and underwater swimming.[2]
In a first for the series, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character cards. The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.[1]

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,,2007,,EA Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game presents the player with a large part of the Harry Potter universe, combining the movie blueprints, J.K. Rowling's drawings and books' descriptions to recreate known places, including the Ministry of Magic, Grimmauld Place and Little Whinging. As well as the main missions, and as part of the new sandbox style of playing, players can explore Hogwarts and interact with objects, using magical spells to earn Discovery points. One can duel Slytherins in the Entrance Courtyard, Paved Courtyard, and specific floor corridors. One can also duel throughout the story. Most of them are played as Harry. Nevertheless, near the end, one will play as Sirius Black and Dumbledore in different duels. Earning Discovery points increases the power of the owned spells, and earns player bonuses, such as behind-the-scenes videos and trophies, which can be viewed in the Room of Rewards. Items in the room such as trophies can also be unlocked by taking part in the various mini games, such as Exploding Snap, Wizard chess and Gobstones. There are various missions to complete which follow the storyline of the film, such as the recruiting of Dumbledore's Army members, or creating havoc when Umbridge is made Headmistress.[citation needed]

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|Harry Potter to Azkaban no ShuujinJP,,2004,Griptonite Games,EA Games,"NA, PAL, JP","The games follows Harry Potter (voiced by Tom Attenborough and Harry Robinson) along with Ron Weasley (voiced by Gregg Chillin) and Hermione Granger (voiced by Harper Marshall) as they return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Prisoner Sirius Black has escaped the wizard prison Azkaban, and is supposedly ready to attack Harry in Hogwarts. The game begins on the Hogwarts Express,[a] ignoring the events at Harry's home. Upon reaching Hogwarts, the trio follow the events of the novel, and learn magic by attending classes.
The spells that can be learned include carpe retractum, a spell that allows an object to be pulled towards the caster, or the caster be pulled towards the object; Steleus, a spell that causes sneezing and expecto patronum, a spell to defend against dementors. Using their skills, the trio, along with Remus Lupin (Jamie Glover) investigate Black. Finding that Black is innocent of all crimes, and looking out for Harry, the team defend Black from a horde of dementors, allowing him to escape.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneNA|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's StonePAL|Harry Potter to Kenja no IshiJP,No,2001,Griptonite Games,EA Games,"NA, PAL, JP","Rubeus Hagrid (Jonathan Kydd), a mysterious giant, leaves an orphaned Harry Potter (Joe Sowerbutts), whose parents were murdered by the evil Lord Voldemort (David de Keyser), on the front door step of his bullying relatives, The Dursleys. For ten years, Harry has lived with the Dursleys, not knowing that he is a wizard, and famous in the wizarding world for being the only one to survive the attacks of Voldemort, whose name no one dares to say. Harry receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and is told who he really is. After buying his school supplies, at Diagon Alley, he boards the Hogwarts Express on platform 9Â¾ with the other students. Once they arrive at Hogwarts, the students are sorted into houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. It is explained that if a student does a good thing or a bad thing, ""points"" will be added or deducted from their ""House Points"". This is important, as the House with the most points will win the House Cup at the end of the year. Harry is sorted into Gryffindor, after pleading with the Sorting Hat, a talking witch's hat, not to place him in Slytherin, notorious for being the house of darker witches and wizards, as well as Lord Voldemort. Once sorted, Harry meets Ron Weasley (Gregg Chillin), a poor boy from a large, pure-blood, wizarding family and Hermione Granger (Emily Robinson), a witch born to Muggle parents.
At school, Harry begins his training as a wizard and learns more about his past. After retrieving a remembrall while riding on a broomstick, for his classmate Neville Longbottom (Harry Robinson), Harry is appointed seeker of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Tricked by Slytherin, Draco Malfoy (Sowerbutts), Harry, Ron and Hermione, accidentally come across a huge three-headed dog on a restricted floor of the castle. After escaping they realise the dog was standing on a trap door which is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, a magical object which grants the user immortality. When Harry is almost killed during a game of Quidditch, by what appeared to be Professor Snape (Allan Corduner) uttering a curse at him, Harry concludes that he is after the Philosopher's Stone.
Harry, Ron and Hermione set out to stop Snape from retrieving the Philosopher's Stone by putting the three-headed dog to sleep with music and going through the trapdoor. The three face a series of obstacles that protect the stone which includes surviving a deadly plant, catching a flying key, playing a life-sized game of Wizards Chess and choosing the correct potion to get through a magical fire. Harry, now alone, expects to face Snape but instead finds Professor Quirrell (Corduner), the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals that Voldemort was living on the back of his head. Harry retrieves the stone and Voldemort tries to get it from him but touching him burns Quirrell's skin. Harry passes out from the struggle of the battle.
He awakens in the school's hospital wing with Professor Dumbledore (de Keyser), the headmaster, by his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed but it wouldn't stop Voldemort from returning. He reassures Harry that if their battles did no more than slow Voldemort's return then he may never come back.
During the end-of-year feast, Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry sees it as the best evening of his life and one that he will never forget.
","The player controls the character Harry Potter from a third-person perspective.[12]
In the PC versions, the game is played like a third-person action and puzzle game. The story follows a linear progression, separated into levels with a specific end goal. Spells are learned progressively via lesson levels, and unlock increasingly complex puzzles. The spells featured are as follows: The Flipendo Jinx, which can be used to stun enemies and push objects around; The Alohomora Charm, which unlocks doors and chests; Wingardium Leviosa, which can levitate objects; Lumos, which causes platforms of light to appear; Incendio, which can disable aggressive plants. The storyline follows Harry through the main elements of the book's plot, including rescuing Hagrid's dragon Norbert, advancing through the various protections around the Philosopher's Stone, and eventually defeating Lord Voldemort. There are also several levels in which Harry can fly on a broomstick and play Quidditch - this gameplay can also be independently accessed through the start menu.
Like the Windows version, the game is a third-person action adventure game. However, the story is arranged in a completely different fashion to the PC version, and features different story events and gameplay. It was developed in the UK by Argonaut.
The game is split into seven sections, four of which can be revisited freely and explored to find collectables. Collectables in the game are either Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, which can be traded with Fred and George Weasley for the password to a portrait guarding a special collectable, or Famous Witches and Wizards cards, which can be found throughout the castle or in exchange for completing mini-games.
The Game Boy Color game is a role-playing game, similar to games like PokÃ©mon and Final Fantasy. The player controls Harry, starting from when Hagrid brings him to Diagon Alley. It follows the story of the book closely, with almost all the scenes from that point on in the book being playable, except for the addition of bands of monsters such as rats, bats, and spiders roaming most of the locations. The spells are used for combat, rather than interacting with the environment.
The Game Boy Advance game is completely different from the Game Boy Color game. The Game Boy Advance game is a top down puzzle game. The player explores Hogwarts, and must attend classes which often include a challenge of collecting a certain number of items, such as challenge stars or potion ingredients. This game features the familiar monsters from the other games in the series, such as snails and gnomes.
A new, separate game Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was made for newer consoles in 2003 by Warthog Games, 2 years after the original versions. Its gameplay differed greatly from the other versions, followed the film far more closely than the other games, though it was criticised for reusing the spells and world map from the Chamber of Secrets version of the game.

Harukanaru Toki no Naka de (Haruka: Beyond the Stream of Time),,2002,Inis,Koei,JP,"On the first day of a new school term, high school student Akane Motomiya, her classmate Tenma Morimura, and their underclass friend Shimon Nagareyama are sucked into a mysterious old well. When they awake, they are in KyÅ (äº¬), another world that resembles Kyoto during the Heian Period. According to the young scion of the Star Clan (æã®ä¸æ), Fujihime, Akane is the RyÅ«jin no Miko (é¾ç¥ã®ç¥å­, Priestess of the Dragon God) who has come to save KyÅ from the ambitions of the Oni Clan (é¬¼ã®ä¸æ). In this task, Akane has the help of eight beautiful and single men known as the HachiyÅ (å«è), and her friends Tenma and Shimon number among them. Initially, Akane is bewildered by her new circumstances, but she gradually comes to face up to her own destiny and understand the world of KyÅ.
","Harukanaru Toki no Naka de places the player in the role of a girl who is surrounded by attractive young men, and gives her the option of trying to win the heart of one and live happily ever after. The heroine must also fight evil with the help of the attractive young men. The result is a hybrid game with a visual novelâlike interaction mode, a simple role-playing video game battle mode, and a board gameâlike map.
Haruka is made up of ten chapters, eight of which involve the core gameplay. These chapters take place over a two-week period and involve traveling around the KyÅ map, searching for various key items. KyÅ is made up of roughly 20 areas and it is possible to visit three in one day. However, most areas are possessed by onryÅ (æ¨é) vengeful ghosts that must be dispelled before you can enter, and fighting them consumes one of the three visit chances.
Haruka's battle system is limited in comparison to most CRPGs of its day. The maximum party size is 3 characters, but only Akane is under the direct control of the player. Though Akane can attack and defend, her other abilities â the use of healing items and spells, and the ability to encourage her comrades, are more useful. There is no magic point system as such. Casting spells is based on the morale of the HachiyÅ members and the number of elemental fuda (æ­) cards Akane has. Furthermore, there is no experience system and the character's hit points are refilled automatically between fights. The main reward for fighting, besides gaining entrance to a given area, is the chance to gain the trust of HachiyÅ. The greater a HachiyÅ member's rapport with Akane, the more effective he will be in battle.

Hey Arnold!: The Movie,,2002,Altron,THQ,"NA, PAL","Arriving home from a basketball game, Arnold Shortman and his best friend Gerald Johanssen learn that FutureTech Industries (FTI) CEO Alphonse Perrier du von Scheck has announced plans to redevelop the entire neighborhood as a luxurious high-rise shopping mall. That night, Helga Pataki finds that her father, Big Bob, is working with FTI to build a new super-sized branch of his beeper store in the proposed mall. She ultimately sides with her father, though is hesitant to do so because of her love for Arnold.
Arnold hosts a demonstration against FTI, but it fails when their permit is stolen by Scheck's employees and Arnold's grandmother Gertie Shortman is arrested, causing the neighbors to sell their homes to FTI. Arnold's grandfather Phil Shortman tells the story of the ""Tomato Incident"", a major Revolutionary War battle fought in the city. Arnold realizes that the neighborhood had to have been declared a historic district after the war, effectively ensuring its preservation; however, the legal document granting its landmark status was sold to Scheck, who denies obtaining the document.
As the deadline draws near, Arnold gets a mysterious phone call from ""Deep Voice"" (a ""Deep Throat""-esque character), who informs Arnold that the document is actually in his office safe. Arnold and Gerald steals the key to the safe from Scheck's assistant, Nick Vermicelli. Nick later notices the missing key, and informs Scheck. Meanwhile, Phil and the boarders try to devise a backup plan in case Arnold fails. The plan is to wire the storm drain tunnels beneath their street with dynamite to intercept FTI's construction equipment. Big Bob later teams up with them after discovering Nick's contract states Scheck will control 51% of his company and swindle him as a result.
With help from agent Bridget, Arnold and Gerald infiltrate the FTI headquarters, only for them to discover that Scheck has the document in his hand. Because his ancestor, a governor of the British forces, was humiliated by the ""Tomato Incident"", Scheck intends to demolish the neighborhood and replace it with a building carrying his name on it. He destroys the document to ensure that his plans will proceed, before summoning his guards to get rid of Arnold and Gerald. They escape, but believe they have failed, until ""Deep Voice"" advises Arnold to obtain the FTI's security-camera footage of Scheck burning the document.
After Arnold discovers that ""Deep Voice"" is Helga, she reluctantly professes her love for Arnold. Helga and Arnold escape the building, and meet Gerald on a city bus, convincing the driver Murray to race home when realizing that his girlfriend lives in the same neighborhood. Despite several near-collisions, the kids eventually make it back unharmed. Mayor Dixie arrives at the scene, along with the police and a news crew. Accessing the large ScheckVision jumbotron poised atop a nearby building, Arnold and Bridget show everyone the footage of Scheck burning the document. Dixie officially restores the neighborhood's status as a historic site.
Scheck arrives, demanding to know why demolition has not begun. He sees the footage of himself burning the document on the monitor, and realizes he's caught and is facing prison time. Having escaped prison, Gertie sabotages his car, and Scheck is promptly arrested. Harold inadvertently sits down on the detonator that ignites Phil's explosives, causing the jumbotron monitor to be destroyed. Helga denies ever having loved Arnold, claiming that she said those things in ""the heat of the moment"". Arnold, unconvinced, pretends to accept it as she returns home.

Hikaru no Go,,2002,KCEJ,Konami,JP,"While exploring his grandfather's shed, Hikaru Shindo stumbles across a Go board haunted by the spirit of Fujiwara-no-Sai, a Go player from the Heian era. Sai wishes to play Go again, having not been able to since the late Edo period, when his ghost appeared to Honinbo Shusaku, a top Go player of that period. Sai's greatest desire is to attain the Kami no Itte (ç¥ã®ä¸æ, ""Divine Move"") â a perfect move. Because Hikaru is apparently the only person who can perceive him, Sai inhabits a part of Hikaru's mind as a separate personality, coexisting, although not always comfortably, with the young boy.
Urged by Sai, Hikaru begins playing Go despite an initial lack of interest in the game. He begins by simply executing the moves Sai dictates to him, but Sai tells him to try to understand each move. In a Go salon, Hikaru twice defeats Akira Toya, a boy his age who plays Go at professional level, by following Sai's instruction. Akira subsequently begins a quest to discover the source of Hikaru's strength, an obsession which will come to dominate his life.
Hikaru becomes intrigued by the great dedication of Akira and Sai to the game and decides to start playing solely on his own. He is a complete novice at first, but has some unique abilities to his advantage; for instance, once he has a basic understanding of Go, he can reconstruct a game play by play from memory. Through training at Go clubs, study groups, and practice games with Sai, he manages to become an Insei and later a pro, meeting various dedicated Go players of different ages and styles along the way. He also demonstrates a natural talent for the game and remains determined to prove his own abilities to Akira, Sai, and himself.
Hikaru enters the Hokuto Cup, an international tournament for under-18 Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Go professionals. As the highest-ranking under-18 pro, Akira qualifies for the tournament, but Hikaru has to compete in a series of games to become one of the three Japanese competitors. His friends Waya and Ochi also enter the qualifying matches. He meets Kiyoharu Yashiro, a player from the Kansai Ki-in, whose style is as strange and offbeat as his own. Hikaru, along with Akira and Kiyoharu Yashiro, are selected to represent Japan, while Suyong Hong (a Korean Go player who was beaten by Hikaru earlier in the series) and two others represent Korea and three of Shinichiro Isumi's Chinese friends represent their country.
The captain of the Korean Go team, Ko Yong Ha, is interviewed and his remarks are translated for Japanese viewers. The translator makes an error which causes it to appear that he is disparaging the skill of Honinbo Shusaku, who, like Hikaru, was possessed by Sai. Although Ko Yong Ha later finds out, he refuses to correct the error and instead emphasizes it when he realizes that it enrages Hikaru, who takes it as a direct affront to Sai. Considering their achievements and skills, Hikaru is still slightly under Akira. Therefore, their team coach, Atsushi Kurata, chooses Akira to be the captain. However, Hikaru wants to play against Ko Yong Ha, who is the captain in Korea, in order to show him that Sai is the most skillful Go player in the history of the game. Atsushi Kurata grants Hikaru's request when they play against Korea in the tournament because he sees the burning spirit in him. At the end, Hikaru loses by only half a point. Japan eventually comes in last, behind Korea and China. But the Japanese team impressed both professionals from China and Korea because they did much better than what was expected. At the end of the game, Ko Yong Ha asks Hikaru for his reason for playing Go. With tears in his eyes, he answers with the line ""To link the far past, with the far future"". The hidden meaning of this line indicates the links and emotional relationships between Sai, Shusaku, and Hikaru. However, no one understands the context of this line besides Hikaru.
A bonus story, set shortly after the Hokuto Cup event, shows two Inseis, who are ranked 14th and 16th in the group, discussing whether Akira Toya or Hikaru Shindo were stronger. In the Young Lions tournament, they are each paired with Hikaru and Akira, making them change their minds about who is stronger. In the second round, Hikaru and Akira are paired against each other and begin a match, but the conclusion is unknown.

During the journey, Bilbo meets the injured elf Lianna, and helps her. At the Misty Mountains, the group is attacked by goblins; after the ensuing fight, Bilbo falls into the caves and is knocked unconscious. He awakens alone and lost, and wanders in the dark, finding a ring and meeting Gollum. After reuniting with the dwarves and Gandalf, they are attacked by goblins and wargs, but are saved by a band of eagles who take them to Mirkwood Forest. While wandering through the forest, Bilbo and the dwarves get captured by Wood Elves and taken to the dungeons of Thranduil. Using the power of the ring, Bilbo enters Thranduill's hall, where he meets Lianna, who helps him free the dwarves. They escape to Lake-town, a settlement close to the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo becomes friends with Bard, captain of the town guard, who shoots and kills Smaug when the dragon attacks the town.
Later, an army of humans and wood elves head toward the Lonely Mountain to claim the dwarves' treasure; to prevent a battle, Bilbo sneaks out of the mountain with the Arkenstone, a treasure of great importance, and gives it to Bard, who offers to return it to Thorin in return for the rest of the treasure. Thorin refuses, denouncing Bilbo as a traitor, and a battle eventually breaks out between five armies who want the dwarf treasure. The battle ends with the goblins defeated, and the humans, elves, and dwarves having made peace; Thorin, mortally wounded, apologizes to Bilbo. Lake-town begins to rebuild, and Bilbo and Gandalf return to the Shire.
","The Hobbit is primarily a platform game, with elements of hack and slash combat and some rudimentary puzzle aspects, played from a third-person perspective (the Game Boy Advance version is played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view).[4] The player controls Bilbo Baggins, the majority of which is built around basic platforming; Bilbo can jump, climb ropes and ladders, hang onto ledges, swing on vines, etc. Progression through the game is built around quests. Every level features multiples quests which must be completed in order to progress to the next level. Many of the levels also feature optional sidequests which do not have to be completed, but which can yield substantial rewards if they are.[5]
Bilbo has three weapons available to him during combat. He begins the game with his walking stick, which can be used in melee combat, and stones, which he can throw. Later in the game, he acquires a dagger, Sting. All three weapons can be powered up by finding magical scrolls scattered throughout the game. These scrolls grant such abilities as increased damage, jump attacks, double and triple combo attacks, and charged attacks.[6] The game also features the use of the One Ring, which can temporarily turn Bilbo invisible, allowing him to avoid certain enemies.[7][8]
Bilbo's health system is based upon ""Courage Points"". At the start of the game, he has three health points. For every 1000 Courage Points he collects, he acquires an extra health point. Courage Points come in the form of diamonds, with different colors representing different numerical values. For example, a blue diamond equals one Courage Point, a green diamond equals ten, etc. Bilbo's progress in gaining a new health point is shown in his courage meter, which is on screen at all times.[9] For the most part, Courage Points are scattered throughout the levels and awarded for completing quests. Some of the higher value diamonds are hidden off the main path of a level, while the lowest level diamonds (blue) are often used to indicate to the player where they are supposed to be heading.[10]
At the end of each chapter, the player is taken to a vendor, where they can spend the in-game currency, silver pennies. Items available for purchase include stones, healing potions, antidotes, skeleton keys, temporary invincibility potions, additional health points, and the ability to increase the maximum number of stones and health potions which Bilbo can carry.[11]
Pennies, healing potions, antidotes and, often, quest items and weapon upgrades can be found in chests throughout the game. Often, chests will simply open when Bilbo touches them, but sometimes, the chests are locked, and Bilbo must pick the lock. This involves a timed minigame in which the player must align a pointer or select a specific target. Some chests will have only one minigame to complete, but chests containing more important items will have more, up to a maximum of eight. If Bilbo misses the pointer/target, the timer will jump forward; if he hits a red pointer or target, the minigame will end immediately. Penalties for failing to open a chest include losing health points or being poisoned. If the player has a skeleton key, they can bypass the minigames and open the chest immediately.[12]

The disciplines are Horse Care, Cross Country, Dressage, Showjumping, and later Foal Care and Learning. The player must also have a high social rating, which is obtained by spending time in the Student Centre talking to other academy riders, performing well in disciplines, taking and displaying photographs in the Student Centre, and purchasing items from the shops. Between training and caring for their horse, foal, and talking to the other riders, the player may go shopping, change their attire in their bedroom, study in the library, and go for a walk with their horse. There is a total of ten secret figurines hidden in the game. 
Throughout the game, the player is given free control of the protagonist or the horse. There are numerous cutscenes, events where the player character must find something, and riddles. These events, combined with the contrasting disciplines, ensure variable gameplay.

Hot Potato!,,2001,Pukka Games,Bam Entertainment,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game tasks the player with navigating a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings.[1][2] The player's bus holds female members of the alien race, and the player can shoot the females from the front of the bus in order to clear the alien potatoes.[1] The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin to pile up in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color.[1] The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through.[1] The game can end prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.[1][2]
Hot Potato features seven missions and seven score challenges. Mission mode requires the player to clear out a set number of an alien species.[2] There are multiple alien species in the mode and the mission does not finish until the player gets rid of enough of a certain species chosen by the game from the road.[2] Score challenge mode tasks the player with clearing away a certain number of aliens in order to reach a pre-determined score.[2] The game contains bonus levels which are longer than normal levels if the player is able to complete missions under a certain time period.[2]

Peter's 17 year old son, Maxwell ""Max"" Justice (voiced by David Kaufman), insists on his dad's robot ""Gearhead"" that he should try to track down whoever stole the cars and attempt to retrieve them all (in the GBA version, however, the robot, ""Gearhead"" is the playable character). He is confronted with various ""villains"" on his quest, such as Conrad ""Nitro"" Byrne, Billy Bob ""Backroads"" Belcher, Fast Lane Friscatti, Simon ""Slick"" Deluca and Rupert Jacoby, all of whom work for the main antagonist of the game, Otto Von Diesel (Dr. Peter Justice's former associate on the Hot Wheels engineering team), whoâs trying to get both the prototype car and Velocity X so he can go back in time and destroy the Justice family and thereby prevent any and all Hot Wheels cars from ever existing.
","In the main Adventure mode, the player has to beat all 14 missions, while completing tasks in each one. These tasks vary from destroying a few vehicles, collecting items, racing/battling a boss, and more. The game's missions take place across 5 different locations, with three missions in each world, except for the final world, which only has 2 missions.
In the GBA version, the story mode is simply races mixed with tasks given by the Professor such as destroying other vehicles and collecting items. At the end of each, a boss is raced.
In the Challenge mode, the player has to complete all 18 challenges. Each challenge comes with various tasks, such as achieving ""x"" Stunt points, collecting ""x"" gears, or reaching the finish before the clock hits 00:00. Along the way, new vehicles, as well as new race/battle maps and weapons, are unlocked. In the GBA version the Challenges are Battle, where the player destroys opponents; and Tag, where the player rams opponents.
The game also has a Drag Race mode, a Battle mode, and a Joyride mode. The Drag Race and Battle modes are both single-player and multiplayer (except in the PC version of the game). The Joyride, in essence, is free roam. The player can also unlock cars in Joyride by collecting all ten gears or finding the hidden key in each map. These modes are absent in the GBA version.
The player begins with six vehicles, and three in the GBA version. The game has 27 additional vehicles that can be unlocked by successfully completing various challenges and missions.  Each car is rated on its speed, grip, stunt, and armor.

The Incredibles|Mr. IncredibleJP,Yes,2004,Helixe,THQ,"NA, PAL, JP","The mime-styled, French supervillain Bomb Voyage attempts a bank heist in the fictional American city of Metroville, but Bob Parr, alias Mr. Incredible, guided by his friend, the ice-powered superhero Frozone (secretly Lucius Best), works to stop his plans. Meanwhile, the metamorphic heroine Elastigirl battles against Voyage's mime minions across the Metroville skyline stretch. Mr. Incredible captures Bomb Voyage in the bank when his fanboy, Buddy Pine, shows up. Mr. Incredible is dismissive of Buddy Pine, and Bomb Voyage sneakily plants a bomb on Buddy's cape, who flies away with his rocket boots to notify the police. Mr. Incredible fortunately notices the bomb on Buddy's cape, and grabs hold of Buddy to embark on a wild ride above the city.
Mr. Incredible and the bomb both fall onto a rooftop, where the bomb detonates harmlessly as Bomb Voyage appears in a helicopter. Voyage attempts to kill Mr. Incredible with bombs, rockets and laser beams, but Mr. Incredible throws the bombs back at the helicopter, causing it to spin wildly out of control, heavily damaged. Bomb Voyage flees the scene, Mr. Incredible having defeated his madcap foe.
Fifteen years later, superheroes across America have been long-since sued and outlawed for causing too much public destruction and are forced by the US government (chiefly the CIA) to permanently remain themselves in their civilian identities and live normal lives in hiding. Mr. Incredible has married Elastigirl, who has become Helen Parr, and they have three children together: Violet (who possesses force-field and invisibility powers), Dash (a 190+ mph speedster), and Jack-Jack (who does not appear to have obtained any superhuman abilities).
After narrowly escaping an apartment inferno on an illegal heroic excursion with Frozone, Mr. Incredible is approached by a mysterious woman named Mirage, who tells him about a secret organization based on a remote South Pacific island called Nomanisan. Meanwhile, Dash is late for school and has to race through the Metroville traffic to reach his school on time.
The organization's latest invention, the Omnidroid Mark 08, is endangering the island and its personnel. After a rough beach landing on Nomanisan Island, Mr. Incredible encounters numerous hostile robots before he finds and destroys the Omnidroid during a volcanic eruption. The entire battle is witnessed by Mirage and her anonymous employer through the eyes a robotic bird. The shadowy employer remarks that Mr. Incredible's victory is surprising, and asks Mirage to issue him new assignments.
After weeks of rigorous training and having received an improved suit from superhero tailor Edna Mode, Mr. Incredible returns to Nomanisan well-prepared for another mission. When he reaches the conference room, he fights through numerous armed security guards, deadly robots and laser systems in the robot arena, but once he reaches the empty meeting room, an improved Omnidroid (the Mark 09), appears suddenly from behind a huge sliding wall and grabs Mr. Incredible, quickly overpowering and trapping him. The Omnidroid's creator, Syndrome, appears, who is Mirage's secret employer and reveals himself to be an adult (and very hostile) Buddy Pine. He reveals that he wants revenge on Mr. Incredible by killing off him and the world's other superheroes. Mr. Incredible is remorseful for his treatment of Syndrome, and escapes his clutches by jumping off the great falls. He evades Syndrome's life-sign scanner by hiding behind the skeletal remains of his superhero friend Gazerbeam (whom Syndrome had previously dispatched in an undersea cave). Unfortunately, he is later captured and imprisoned in Syndrome's base when he breaks into the villain's secret computer room, learning of Syndrome's plans to unleash his perfected Omnidroid (the Mark 10) on Metroville. Syndrome then intends to take credit for stopping the robot and saving the city, tarnishing the reputations of Mr. Incredible and his allies in the process, before he becomes the world's only super using his weaponized inventions.
Elastigirl flies to Nomanisan island to rescue her husband and safely stores a stowed-away Violet and Dash in a cave, sneaking into Syndrome's complex with the goal of finding Mr. Incredible. She works her way through the hidden base and into Syndrome's volcanic lair. The next morning, Violet and Dash accidentally activate a robotic cockatoo's alarm system and are forced to use their powers to escape from Syndrome's guards. After a 100-mile dash through the jungle and across the beaches and lakes of the island, and Violet's crossing of Syndrome's henchmen (thanks to the use of her invisibility), the two learn not to be ashamed of their powers and work together, combining their abilities to form the Incredi-ball. They battle henchmen and robots, eventually finding their parents, with Mirage having had a change of heart and freeing Mr. Incredible.
As the Incredible family finally meets up outside the secret lava labs, Mirage helps them activate and launch one of Syndrome's rockets from the rocket silo, which they use to reach Metroville, where the Omnidroid is wreaking havoc on the populace. The Incredibles and Frozone work together to destroy the robot, stop Syndrome and save the world. Syndrome escapes from the battle in the city, but is later killed offscreen when he attempts to kidnap Jack-Jack Parr as revenge. The Incredibles meet with their family friend and CIA agent Rick Dicker, who acquits and relieves them of their lives as superheroes in hiding, and they are loved by the public again for their efforts.

International Karate Advanced,,2001,,Studio 3,PAL,NaN,"The core game is a two-dimensional, one-on-one, versus fighting game. Players take on the roles of martial artists competing in a kumite tournament. Rather than wearing down an opponent's health, the goal is instead to score single solid hits. After each hit, combat stops and both combatants are returned to their starting positions. Depending on how well players hit their opponent, they score either a half-point or a full point. Matches can be quite brief, as only two full points are required to win, and a point can be quickly scored just seconds after a round begins.
In single-player mode, successive opponents increase in difficulty from novice white belts to master black belts. Play continues as long as the player continues to win matches. Between fights, bonus mini-games focusing on rhythm and timing appear, including one in which the player must break a number of stacked boards using the fighter's head. As in newer games in the genre, starting specifically with Street Fighter, the fights take place against a variety of backdrops (eight in total) representing different locations in the world: the Mount Fuji (Tokyo, Japan), the Sydney Harbour (Sydney, Australia), the Statue of Liberty (New York, USA), the Forbidden City (Beijing, China), the Christ the Redeemer (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), the Palace of Westminster (London, England), the Parthenon (Athens, Greece), and the Great Pyramid of Giza (Cairo, Egypt).
The title utilizes the standard one-button joystick, allowing players to execute a variety of karate techniques. Unlike modern 2D fighting games, players do not turn around if the opponent is behind them and must instead execute one of three ""turn-around"" maneuvers to change direction.

In addition, pressing a certain key or keys would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take. Additionally, it was possible (on the Amiga version, at least) to type in four-letter curse words; the game would respond first by rebuking the player for their use of such language, and upon the second offence would reset the game.

Tracking down his technology to the harbor, Stark dons another Iron Man armor to retrieve it. Battling operatives of Advanced Idea Mechanics upon his arrival, Stark comes across his cousin Morgan Stark, in which the former defeats easily in a battle. Despite getting back his armor, Iron Man discovers that Morgan uploaded the armor's data systems, which would give the benefactors the ability to reverse engineer his designs and turn them against Stark.
Iron Man follows the transmission to the woods, where he encounters a robot army commissioned by an unknown mastermind. The Blizzard appears, and as Iron Man gains the advantage, the villain flees. Chasing the Blizzard to a wintry habitat, Iron Man fights his way through the Blizzard's defenses before encountering him again. The Blizzard explains when Stark's technology is finally replicated, an army will arise that would be nigh impossible to stop. As the two battle, Iron Man disables a chamber that regenerates the Blizzard's powers, enabling the hero to neutralize his longtime foe. Iron Man discovers a back door to a tower, and enters it to find out who is the culprit.
After Iron Man breaks through the towar's security, the Crimson Dynamo reveals himself as the one who concocted the entire scenario. Now armed with Stark's armor calibrations, the Dynamo fights Iron Man to a standstill. However, Iron Man exploits a weakness within the Dynamo's armor by overloading it with his energy blasts, helping Iron Man secure the victory over the Dynamo. This results in the armor releasing energy, triggering explosions throughout the tower. Iron Man escapes, as the Dynamo is seemingly killed in the process. In its aftermath, Iron Man ponders if the next time could have a different outcome.
","The basic design is that of a platform game, where players use Iron Man's repulsor blasts and shoulder tackle to knock out his enemies, but each use drains the armor's energy, which is slowly recharged automatically or replenished by items scattered throughout the levels. Power orbs allow to unleash a massive chest-mounted cannon or to detonate a bomb that clears the entire screen of enemies. Iron Man's jump ability is actually a boost that can fly short distances.[1] Villains include Iron Man's cousin Morgan Stark, Blizzard, and the Crimson Dynamo.

","The game is a simple forward-scrolling rail shooter, similar to the Star Fox series. Only the Game Boy Advance's directional pad, A, and Start buttons are used during gameplay.[3] The ship remains locked at a set speed and cannot brake or speed up.[4]
The player encounters more than fifteen types of enemy, not including level bosses. Some are easy to destroy; others, including the fire creatures found on the Iridion home world, are indestructible and must be avoided. Other enemies prevent the player from dodging enemy fire by laying mines to block paths. Passive objects, such as garbage or asteroids, can damage or destroy the player's craft. Enemies vary in armor and weaponryâsome cannot return fire but travel in waves to ram the player.[4]:19â22 The player's ship can use five types of weapons, with three levels of power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups that match the current weapon's power; collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.[4]:5
Each level has the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft does not move forward, but hovers in front of the boss.[5] Each boss has a single vulnerability which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft.[4]:4 An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.[4]:28

After performing a motorbike jump through a large poster as a publicity stunt, he is then taken to the first scene where he performs a high-speed freeway car chase after the Brickster, who has been ironically cast as the main villain of the film. Upon completion, Pepper is given free roam of Lego Island, allowing him to explore and complete side missions as he continues the film in other locations throughout the island. As the player makes more progress in missions, it becomes more and more apparent that the Brickster has plans of his own, and later he kidnaps the Infomaniac and reveals his tower that his Brickster-Bots have built and has made a supercomputer that will disassemble the entire world. Pepper naturally comes to the rescue while the host tries to shut down the supercomputer. He once again outwits and imprisons the Brickster while the supercomputer was instead reprogrammed to disassemble the tower, allowing the film to be completed and released on schedule (which the player is able to view upon completion of the game). In the end, Pepper has access to all areas of the island, allowing him to redo scenes of the movie and different tasks.
The majority of the original Lego Island and Lego Island 2 cast return. Pepper Roni remains the star of the game, while his adoptive parents Mama and Papa Brickolini continue their career running a pizzeria. The Infomaniac's role has been reduced from the player's guide to a simple cameo. Others retain their roles, such as Ed Mail the postman, Nick and Laura Brick the police officers, Mrs. Post the grocer, and others. The studio director is introduced, serving as a guide for the player through the stunts and giving him various objectives throughout the game itself.
Unlike Lego Island and Lego Island 2, Pepper does not speak any dialogue in the game aside from grunts and one-word exclamations, making him a silent protagonist. When doing stunt work, however, he can make comments that are more than one word.
","Like Lego Island 2, the player controls Pepper throughout the game, exploring the island in a non-linear style. Players are able to control and ride various vehicles throughout the city (only once they have obtained their correct licences). There are various collectible items scattered throughout that will rebuild animals composed of large Lego pieces, and there are also minigames in some parts of the city, such as helping one of the grocery store owners arrange and organize crates for storage.
When filming stunts, the player is briefed by the director on how to perform the stunts within the scene, followed by a ""practice room"" where Pepper can practice controlling the vehicle used in front of a bluescreen (as various Brickster Bots control the mechanics for him). The player is then taken to ""perform"" the scene by playing the minigame within it. Upon its completion, players are taken to the screening room to see a ""take"" of the scene, which includes some humorous and unintentional event taking place behind the scenes (different difficulties play different takes). Players are then graded on their performance, based on how quickly objectives were completed and how many bonus stunts were performed.

It's Mr. Pants,,2005,Rare,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The basic idea of the game is to create rectangles which have to be two-by-three blocks or larger to clear them from the grid. Blocks cannot be placed on top of blocks of the same color that are already on the grid, but they can be placed on top of blocks of any other color which causes the different blocks on the grid to disappear.
The game incorporates three main game modes: Puzzle, in which players must clear a puzzle board using a limited selection of specific blocks; Wipeout, in which players have a two minute time limit to clear all blocks from the grid; and Marathon, in which the available grid space is slowly restricted while players attempt to achieve the highest score possible. Each mode has four difficulty levels, ranging from ""Easy"" to ""Special"", with each difficulty unlocked after clearing the previous one. Players are awarded a trophy for each successfully completed difficulty level. Upon completing all four difficulties in Puzzle mode, a fourth game type is unlocked called ""Max the Mystical Mouse's Muddle"", in which players must clear rectangles of specific sizes as provided by the eponymous Max.

Although Acme Oil Co. has been destroyed by James Pond, Pond's arch enemy Dr. Maybe survived and has retreated to the North Pole where he has taken over Santa's workshop. Dr. Maybe is holding Santa's workers hostage (in most versions of the game they are penguins, in some they are elves), and has turned many of Santa's helpers into his own twisted and dangerous assistants. James Pond is recruited to infiltrate Santa's grotto, free the captive penguins, retrieve the stolen toys for the children of the world, and defeat Dr. Maybe once and for all. This time, however, due to the greater risks involved in this mission, Pond is given a robotic suit and the code name ""RoboCod"" (a play on RoboCop). This suit gives Pond superhuman strength and agility as well as enabling him to stretch his midsection almost indefinitely and reach otherwise impossibly high areas.
","James starts outside Santa's toy factory. There are many doors, each of which leads to a stage with many differently-themed levels, 50 in total. Hostile creatures lurk in these levels, and they come in many forms. There are no weapons in the game, so James must jump on them to defeat them. After completing two ""doors"", James goes on to another door where a boss awaits.
James's body armor enables him to extend his body vertically to incredible lengths and grab hold of the ceiling or platforms above him. This allows him to travel along the ceiling and drop down on the top of an unsuspecting enemy, or to get to otherwise inaccessible areas. James can also pick up items that provide points. Power-ups include extra lives and wings that grant James the ability to fly. From time to time James may enter vehicles, namely cars, planes or flying bathtubs.

Jet Grind RadioNA|Jet Set RadioPAL,,20032004,Vicarious Visions,"THQ, Sega","NA, PAL","DJ Professor K broadcasts the Jet Set Radio pirate radio station to gangs of youths who roam Tokyo-to, skating and spraying graffiti. One gang, the GGs, competes for turf with the all-female Love Shockers in the shopping districts of Shibuya-Cho, the cyborg Noise Tanks in the Benten entertainment district, and the kaiju-loving Poison Jam in the Kogane dockyard. The authorities, led by Captain Onishima, pursue the gangs with riot police and military armaments. After the GGs defeat Poison Jam, Noise Tanks, and Love Shockers in turf wars, they each drop a piece of a mysterious vinyl record. Professor K says that the mysterious vinyl has the power to summon a demon.
The GGs are joined by Combo and Cube, who explain that their hometown, Grind City, has been overtaken by the Rokkaku business conglomerate. They ask the GGs to help them to free their friend, Coin, who has been captured by the Rokkaku. The Rokkaku pursue the GGs and steal the vinyl record. Poison Jam explains that the Rokkaku CEO, Goji Rokkaku, plans to use the record to make a contract with the demon and take over the world. The GGs defeat Goji in the rooftop of his headquarters by destroying his turntable. Freedom is returned to the streets of Tokyo-to. Combo reveals that The Devil's Contract was an old record with no demonic powers and that wealth had driven Goji to insanity.
","Player controls a member of a gang of graffiti-tagging inline skaters. The game consists of three types of levels: Street, Rival Showdown, and Trial.[4] The Street levels come in two categories.[4] The first is to tag every graffiti point in each area previously tagged by a rival gang before the timer runs out while evading the authorities.[5] The second category serves as a boss battle by chasing the rival gang members and spraying graffiti on them.[5] The more graffiti points are sprayed, the more deadly the authorities become.[6] Graffiti points are marked by arrows and require paint to tag them.[5][4] Players can spray graffiti by either pressing a single button or inputting commands using the analog stick depending on the size of the graffiti spot. Players are unable if they run out of paint and must be refilled by obtaining yellow and blue spray cans scattered across the stage.[4] Yellow spray cans refill a single spray can and blue spray cans refill five.[4] Enemies will pursue players and attempt to deplete their health.[5] Health can be replenished by obtaining red and green spray cans.[4] Performing tricks add bonus points to the player's overall score and gain access to areas difficult to reach.[4]
In Rival Showdown levels, more playable characters can be unlocked after they are defeated by matching the rival's movements in technique sections or by spraying graffiti before the rival in race sections.[4] Trial levels are unlocked after Street and Rival Showdown levels are cleared in a specific area. There are three kinds of trials: Jet Graffiti, Jet Tech, and Jet Crash.[4] In Jet Graffiti, the objective is to spray all the graffiti points within the time limit. Jet Tech prioritizes in obtaining the top score within the time limit. In Jet Crash, the objective is to reach the goal and spray graffiti on it before the opponent.[4] Players can customize their graffiti by choosing presets, or create their own using the Graffiti editor.[4] By using a VMU, players can upload their graffiti to the official website for other players to use or download graffiti from other players. More Graffiti presets can be unlocked by collecting Graffiti Soul icons scattered throughout stages.[4]

Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,,2001,HumanSoft,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game is a 3D adventure starring a boy named James Isaac Neutron (or Jimmy Neutron for short) and his robot dog Goddard. In the game, the evil King Goobot has abducted some of Jimmy's friends, so Jimmy must begin an intergalactic quest to save them. While progressing through various locales inspired by the movie, players need to solve puzzles using an assortment of gadgets. Also included are various mini-games to play within an amusement park, as well as hidden movie clips, Rugrats and SpongeBob trailers, character bios, and movie trailers to be unlocked.
Played from a traditional third-person perspective, the game consists of five distinct regions linked together by a main hub. Once players decide on a region, they can enter a portal and then be whisked away to a 3D world. Among the environments players explore are Jimmy's House, an Asteroid Surface, an Asteroid Interior, Yolkus Prime, and Retroland Amusement Park. Each region spans multiple levels, with the goal in each being to find a number of key items and special prizes and a shrunken head. A secondary goal in some levels is to locate friends Carl Wheezer, Cindy Vortex, Rose, Nissa, and Zachary.
Enemies trying to prevent Jimmy from succeeding include giant ants and the blob-like Yokians, with villains Ooblar, Poultra, and King Goobot forming the boss encounters. Players can run, jump, kick, and use an assortment of inventions. Health can be replenished by finding slices of blueberry pie, extra lives are awarded for every ten neutrons found, and weapons include the Shrink Ray, Inflato Ray, and the Jimmy Bat. Three types of vehicles can also be used to traverse the levels, the Goddard Pogo, the Goddard Sled, and the Goddard Scooter.
Bonus features include a behind the scenes feature hosted by Nick Cannon, as well as footage from the movie, shorts, and trailers can be unlocked.
A completely different version of the game was developed by AWE Games for PC. Like the Console Versions it is a 3D game, however this version is more of an open world title with areas that can be explored being Jimmy's House and Neighborhood, Jimmy's Lab, Retroville Elementary School, Retroland, Area 51, and Downtown Retroville. These areas can mostly be entered through connected sites, though as these areas are visited, Jimmy is capable of using phone booths to fast travel to these areas. The control system is different and has been tailored for keyboard and mouse controls.
In addition to the main plot, there are several side quests that encourage players to explore. There are escaped carnivorous plants and T-Rexes that Jimmy must use his shrink ray on to collect them and return them to his lab. There are also Red and Blue Neutrons scattered throughout the world. Blue Neutrons act as fuel for Jimmy's jetpack, while Red Neutrons act as a type of special collectable found in obscure or hard to reach places.
As the game progresses, Jimmy gets access to several inventions which aid his progress and encourage exploration further, most of these inventions include optional tutorial levels that teach players how to use them. The use of all these inventions are necessary to find all the Red Neutrons in each environment and complete the game.
Most notably, despite not reprising his role in the console versions, Rob Paulsen lends his voice to this version of the game.

Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2: Power Version,,2002,Natsume,Smilesoft,JP,"The games take place in the year 2020 and there are special mobile phones equipped with a unique antenna called D-Shot which allows teleportation through ""antenna trees"". A 10-year-old boy named Shigeki finds one of these phones and is accidentally transported with another boy, Matsukiyo, to another world when he loses a baseball near an ""antenna tree"".
This world is full of fantasy creatures called DenjÅ«, who all own a D-Shot and use them to call their friends to help them compete in battles. These phone battles are also known as Telefang. Shigeki becomes a T-Fanger and travels the DenjÅ« world, trying to learn more about it. At the same time, he gets wrapped up in several plots involving evil DenjÅ« as well as other humans, who may or may not be T-Fangers.
The games follow the story of KyÅ, a blue-haired 10-year-old T-Fanger who travels to the DenjÅ« world to look for his missing father. His friend Midori accompanies him on the journey. During his adventure, he encounters  a DenjÅ« named Diablos, who is killing off the ""antenna trees"" as he is not happy with the fact that humans are entering the DenjÅ« world.
After Diablos kills all but one ""antenna tree"", that tree becomes the only gate between the two worlds. KyÅ has to prevent Diablos from killing that last ""antenna tree"", or KyÅ will be stuck in the DenjÅ« world forever.
","Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang and Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2 revolve around collecting the phone numbers of various creatures, referred to as DenjÅ« (é»ç£), on a device called D-Shot (ï¼¤ã·ã§ãã, DÄ« Shotto), that the player, classified as a T-Fanger (Tãã¡ã³ã¬ã¼, T fangÄ), encounters and must defeat. These are used to be able to request aid from them at a later time, should he or she require it. The games are played from a third-person, top-down perspective, with the player taking the role of the games' young protagonist and main T-Fanger: Shigeki in Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang and KyÅ in Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2.
One DenjÅ« stays by the player's side at a time and follows him around but in battle he can call up to two other DenjÅ« to help him. DenjÅ« will sometimes give the player their phone numbers after he or she beats them in a random battle but take longer to arrive in battle if they're originally from a distant area, due to getting lost. Sometimes, they may not even show up at all if called, so care must be taken to make sure that the player is not calling a DenjÅ« which is too far away.
All DenjÅ« have a range of statistics (colloquially called ""stats""): Hit Points (HP), Speed, Attack, Defense, Denma Attack and Denma Defense. These statistics determine how powerful, fast or robust any given DenjÅ« is. The type of habitat a DenjÅ« lives in determines how weak it is to attacks from DenjÅ« from other habitats; there is a vulnerability chain that goes from Mountain to Sky, from Sky to Forest, from Forest to Aquatic, from Aquatic to Desert, from Desert to Grassland and, finally, from Grassland to Mountain. This also applies in reverse in the sense that a DenjÅ« of certain types inflicts less damage upon one it is weak to. However, this was slightly changed in Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2, where DenjÅ«'s habitat types are defensive, and attacks are of separate offensive types: Normal, Flame, Thunder, Water, Wind, Rock and Machine. This arrangement makes DenjÅ« a bit more versatile, as they may carry moves that would be effective against opponents they would normally have trouble against.
In battle, the DenjÅ« have an array of two to four attacks specific to their species. The battles are not strictly turn-based; the Speed stat of a DenjÅ« determines how many turns it can take and when. Thus, for example, a DenjÅ« with a higher Speed stat could attack twice for every time a DenjÅ« with a lower Speed stat goes once, also attacking before the slower DenjÅ« can get a hit in. Battles are performed in matches where each team may have anywhere from one to three DenjÅ« participating. Losing causes a game over and the player is then returned to the title screen of the games.
A DenjÅ«'s attacks cannot be altered unless a DenjÅ« evolves. Evolution is achieved by three different methods: ""Natural evolution"" (achieved by training DenjÅ«), ""Modified evolution"" (by giving DenjÅ« certain items in a ""modified evolution"" area) or ""Experimental evolution"" (achieved by taking the DNA of one DenjÅ« with an item called Phone Card and giving it to the DenjÅ« to be ""experimentally evolved""). Some DenjÅ« do not evolve. In Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang, evolution is permanent but in Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2, evolution can be reversed if it was not achieved through ""Natural evolution"".
Many DenjÅ« have a special attack called Denma attack that needs to be charged up and takes multiple turns to execute. This special attack does damage based on the DenjÅ«'s Denma Attack stat and is often considered not to be worth the wait. Due to the time that it takes for the special attack to charge, it is easy for the opponent to attack during multiple turns or to avoid the move entirely. In Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2, instead of having to wait for a Denma attack to charge, its use is limited by a DP meter. There are other attacks that can raise the Attack or Defense stat of a DenjÅ« or heal the user or its allies. These vary from DenjÅ« to DenjÅ«.
The use of items varies greatly between Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang and Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2. In Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang, items are only used for evolving DenjÅ« or gifts, excluding some items that are important to the storyline such as keys to unlock doors or a plush DenjÅ« toy that has been stolen. Evolution items are generally objects that come from the human world. These items are capable of affecting DenjÅ« in certain ways when they are forcibly combined. Such items range from simple objects like pencils and batteries to flamethrowers, computers, cranes and shuriken. DenjÅ« which evolve via ""Modified evolution"" will only do so if they receive a specific item. Certain items also give large amounts of experience points to DenjÅ« without evolving them. In Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2, evolution items are of the same type as DenjÅ« (Mountain, Sky, Forest, Aquatic, Desert or Grassland) and any such item can be used to evolve a DenjÅ« of the same type. However, different items may have certain effects on stat growth. Evolution items can also be thrown at enemy DenjÅ« to attempt to befriend them more easily and the probability of this occurring is increased if the item thrown matches their type. In addition to evolution items, there are also special items which can be held by DenjÅ« to boost one of their stats. Keitai DenjÅ« Telefang 2 also introduced items which can heal a DenjÅ«'s HP and/or DP as well as cure status effects such as paralysis. Items can be purchased at shops or found in treasure chests but may also be picked up after battles or found by running through grass.

They mean to conquer âPekoponâ (their name for  ""Earth"") but fail every time they try.  Their leader, Sergeant Keroro, is incompetent and has little interest in conquering Pekopon. Instead, he like making plastic Gundam models, watching TV, or coming up with schemes to make money. The four other members of the platoon are adorable but violent Private Second Class Tamama; bellicose yet tenderhearted Corporal Giroro; intelligent but mischievous Sergeant Major Kururu; and disciplined but traumatized Lance Corporal Dororo.

Keroro is kept busy with manual labor and constant abuse, primarily from the family daughter, Natsumi. Each member of the platoon finds himself in the care of a human: Giroro's is Natsumi Hinata, whom he falls in love with; Keroro's is Fuyuki Hinata, who considers the sergeant his only true friend; Kururu's is Mutsumi Saburo, who's just as mischievous as him; Dororo's is Koyuki Azumaya, a fellow ninja; and Tamama's is Momoka Nishizawa, who's just as bipolar as him.

After noticing some odd occurrences in their hometown of Oedo, involving a Ghost Woman at the local temple and ghost animals that come from the temple at night, Goemon and Ebisumaru decide to investigate. After defeating the Ghost Woman, she reveals herself to be Kurobei, a ninja cat. She explains that she was looking for strong people to help her, then offers the duo money and tells them to search for her boss, Koban, on Shikoku Island. Upon arrival, they find Hyotoko dancers in town during a festival, of whom some of the townspeople are suspicious. After finding and defeating the Lantern Man, leader of the evil dancers, they rescue Koban, who informs them that Princess Yuki, daughter of the Emperor, is believed to have been kidnapped by an odd group of mimes and clowns counterfeiters known as the Otafu Army. His clan of ninja cats were unable to investigate further because of devices the army has that disable their shapeshifting powers. He then directs the duo to nearby Awaji Island, where Goemon and Ebisumaru find that the army has set up a bizarre, anachronistic amusement park. The pair then make their way across the park to the nearby town of Yamato, where they discover that the army has been recruiting the townspeople. Upon invading the Otafu HQ and defeating its leaders, they free Yae, the ninja. She tells them that the Otafu Army never had Yuki, but that a wise man in Iga may be able to help them. The Old Wise Man's palace in Iga is guarded by an army of robotic clockwork ninjas, and the pair fight through the palace and its leader, Sasuke, to get to the old man's chamber. The Old Wise Man tells them that the White Mirror in the Dragon Pond of faraway Izumo can find what they seek. He uses his ""Miracle Transport Machine"" (which is only a cannon) to shoot them there. To save the princess, the protagonists must travel through different regions of Japan to find clues about the army and the location of the princess.
","Although both characters have different weapons and learn different attacks, they are functionally identical. Their primary short-range weapons have three levels and are improved in range by acquiring grey cats left by defeated enemies. Both characters are also equipped with thrown weapons from the beginning (which decreases money as the player uses it) and can acquire bombs by purchasing them in stores or by winning them in mini-games.
Each character can learn four Judo abilities which are functionally identical between the two characters. Level 1 Judo provides an animal companion for the character which they ride and can use to ram into enemies. Level 2 Judo releases an attack that can damage all enemies on the screen. Level 3 Judo gives the characters the ability to fly temporarily. Level 4 Judo unleashes a powerful repetitive attack.
Most stages (known as ""Warlock Zones"") are separated into two sections. The first section is centered on town exploration where players gather information, buy items, learn special Judo attacks, play minigames, earn money, etc. One of the most notable mini-games available is a recreation of the first level in Gradius, but also includes games such as air hockey, trivia, dice games, and even a lottery.

The second section of each stage is a platforming section where the players fight through minor enemies until they reach the end and defeat a boss. In two-player mode, the characters can work together by having one ride the other piggy-back style. The character riding controls the attacks, while the character being ridden controls the movement and jumping. This can simplify areas with large or awkward jumps as it only requires one player to land successfully. After each stage is completed, a small scene occurs furthering the mostly simple and lighthearted plot, and the next stage is revealed. "

Kidou Gekidan Haro Ichiza: Haro no Puyo Puyo,,2005,,Bandai,JP,NaN,"Generally, the objective of Puyo Puyo games is to defeat your opponent by causing the third column from the left of their side of the screen to become filled with Puyo. Puyo are round, slime-like creatures that, in most variations of the game, fall from the top of the screen in groups of two, three, and four. The pieces can be moved, dropped, and rotated as they fall. The piece falls until it reaches another Puyo or the bottom of the screen.[1] When four or more Puyo of the same color line up adjacent to each other, the Puyo will connect to each other, ""Pop"", and disappear. Puyo of the same color can connect horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.[citation needed]
The Puyo above those that are cleared fall onto other pieces or the bottom of the screen. Simultaneous Pops (åææ¶ã, simultaneous erasing) are created when more than one group is formed at a time.[citation needed]
A Chain is made when falling Puyo cause a new group of Puyo to Pop, making a chain reaction. When a Chain is achieved, Nuisance Puyo, or Ojama Puyo (ãéªé­ã·ã, hindrance Puyo) are sent to either clog the opponent's screen or to cancel out (offset, ç¸æ®º) the Nuisance Puyo sent by the opponent. Nuisance Puyo are translucent pieces that disappear when Puyo are popped next to them. If multiple groups of Puyo are cleared in succession due to a chain, the amount of Nuisance Puyo will increase based solely on the number of steps in the chain. Nuisance Puyo are cached above the opponent's playing field, and do not fall until the attacker's chain concludes, and then the defender puts down a piece. Nuisance Puyo block the opponents' playing fields, and can cause them to lose if one is placed the third spot from the left in the top row.[citation needed]

Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories,,2004,Jupiter,Square Enix,"NA, PAL, JP","Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is set immediately after the events of the first game.[13][14] It is set in Castle Oblivion, a mysterious castle kept by Lord Marluxia.[15] Sora and his teammates are told that the castle causes visitors to lose their memories upon entering.[16] The lobby and areas between floors are white with flower-themed decorations, but each floor can be transformed into a different world from the first Kingdom Hearts game using ""world cards"" created from Sora's memories.[10][17] Like before, many of the worlds of Disney and Square Enix reappear.
Unlike the previous game, the worlds are created from Sora's memories. As such, many of the events experienced in Kingdom Hearts are relived in this game, Sora encounters memory-based versions of Disney characters that he has met before (except Deep Jungle in Tarzan). The individual plotlines differ from those in the original game and revolve around the theme of memory. Just as Kingdom Hearts had several worlds created specifically for that game, Chain of Memories introduces Twilight Town as a world created from memories on ""the other side of Sora's heart"",[18] in addition to the original worlds of Kingdom Hearts.
Sora returns as the game's protagonist.[19] Donald Duck and Goofy are less involved in the gameplay and story. Like the first game, Chain of Memories features numerous characters from both the Final Fantasy series and the Disney animated features canon. Being a direct sequel, many of the characters from the first Kingdom Hearts reappear in this game. As each world and the related characters are recreated from Sora's memories, they interact with Sora as if they had never met before. The game also introduces a handful of new characters. Several are members of the enigmatic Organization. Other new characters include NaminÃ©, a young girl capable of manipulating memories, and DiZ, a mysterious man concealed by red robes and bandages. Riku appears as a playable character in the second story mode. After being sealed in the realm of darkness, Riku heads to the basement of Castle Oblivion, aided by King Mickey Mouse and DiZ.
Six members of the Organization serve as antagonists; four appear in Sora's story mode, and the other two in Riku's. Among the four Sora encounters are Marluxia, the lord of Castle Oblivion; Larxene, Marluxia's assistant; Axel, a double agent with hidden loyalty; and Vexen, Marluxia's unwilling collaborator. Conversely, Riku battles Zexion and Lexaeus, Vexen's allies. Ansem also appears in Riku's story as an entity that attempts to control Riku. Many of the Disney villains return via memory-based recreations like the rest of the Disney characters.
Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket walk down a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive fortress called Castle Oblivion.[10] Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all their abilities.[16] The hooded man explains that the deeper they go into the castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process.[20] He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.[6]
Sora ascends the castle, facing off against other hooded figures who form a group called ""the Organization"" along the way. As Sora loses his memories, he gradually appears to remember a girl named NaminÃ© as an old friend of his, and learns from Organization member Larxene that she is being held prisoner in the castle.[21] He also clashes with a replica of Riku created and controlled by another Organization member, Vexen, and believed by both Sora and the replica himself to be the real Riku. Axel, an Organization double agent, releases NaminÃ© and allows her to meet Sora in person. Sora discovers NaminÃ© to be the one manipulating his memories, having been forced to do so by Marluxia, the lord of Castle Oblivion and the figure who lured Sora there, as part of his plan to overthrow the rest of the Organization with Larxene.[22] Sora climbs to the highest floor and defeats Marluxia, after which NaminÃ© puts Sora and his friends into pod-like machines to help them regain the memories they have lost, even though they will forget the events that transpired in the castle.[23] Before they are put to sleep, Sora and NaminÃ© promise to meet again as real friends once he reawakens, Sora firmly believing that his memories of her and the castle will remain in his heart despite being forgotten.[24]
In Reverse/Rebirth, which occurs congruently with the game's main story, Riku is transported from the realm of darkness to Castle Oblivion's deepest basement, and he fights figments of previous enemies to combat his inner darkness as he climbs upwards. Vexen fights Riku to obtain his data and creates his replica to counter Marluxia's plan. Ansem, still possessing Riku's body, tries to regain control of Riku, but Mickey's power keeps Ansem at bay.[25] On the way, Riku battles and defeats Lexaeus, a member of Vexen's circle, only to be dragged into the realm of darkness. However, he is saved by Mickey when Ansem nearly succeeds in taking Riku's body as his own. With Marluxia eliminated by this time, another of Vexen's allies, Zexion, attempts to dispose of Riku by drowning him in light. Riku is saved by NaminÃ© disguised as Kairi, who helps him to control his darkness, allowing him to defeat Zexion. Riku later meets DiZ, an enigmatic individual interested in Riku who sends him to find NaminÃ©.[26] Riku's replica, who has since learned of his altered memories, seeks to justify his existence by killing Riku, only to be destroyed by him. Riku chooses to face Ansem upon learning from NaminÃ© that Ansem lives in his heart, and defeats him after DiZ summons him for Riku to fight. Riku then sets out on a journey to utilize both his darkness and his light with Mickey as his companion.[27]
","Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a combination between a role-playing video game and collectible card game. The main role-playing aspect is an experience point system that is used to increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or to learn a new skill.[6] The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms.[6][7] Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.[8]
A unique aspect to this game is ""room synthesis"": to advance through the game, the player must utilize Map cards obtained after winning battles to synthesize rooms.[9] The properties of each roomâincluding quality of items and strength of enemiesâare determined by the Map cards the player chooses.[8] Each card has a specific effect: red cards affect the number and type of enemies; green cards affect the power of the player's deck; and blue cards affect the properties of the room itself, such as allowing treasure chests or a save point to appear.[6][10]
The game features three modes of gameplay. The first two are story modes that feature either Sora or Riku, and the third is a two player battle mode. Initially only Sora's story mode is available; once completed, ""Reverse/Rebirth"" mode becomes available.[10] Reverse/Rebirth allows the player to play a second story mode featuring Riku and a link mode where players can battle each other via a Game Link Cable.[9]
Combat uses a card-based battle system executed in real time.[6][11] The player can jump and maneuver around the battle screen as they would on the field map, but all physical attacks, magic, items and summonings are activated by playing cards.[4] Cards are ranked from zero to nine, and are used for making attack combos or breaking enemy cards. With the exception of zero-ranked cards which are more expensive in terms of Card Points (CP) compared to other cards of the same type and have other ranks, more CP are required to place higher-ranked cards in the player's deck. Card Pointsâincreased through level upâlimit the number of cards the player can use in a deck. Cards with rank ""zero"" can break any opposing card or combo if played after the opposing card or combo, but they can be broken by any card or combo as well if it is played after the zero card is played.[12] Breaking an opposing card will cancel that attack and stun the loser of a card break for a short time. Special enemy cards may be obtained by defeating enemies and bosses, and are used to give the player a temporary ability, ranging from enhanced offensive and defensive capabilities to modifying the attributes of certain cards.
Combining cards in sets of three will create combo attacks that are usually more difficult to break because the rank of the combo will be the sum of the ranks of the three cards in the combo. Certain card combinations will create a ""sleight"", a special combination that will create a powerful physical attack, magical spell, or summon attack.[9] When the player runs out of cards, the deck must be reloaded. Additionally, using a card combination will cause the first card in the combo to become unusable until the end of combat.[8]
Sora's and Riku's stories differ gameplay-wise in several ways. In Sora's story, Sora obtains cards by defeating enemies or through Moogle Shops.[9] In some cases, Sora must earn the specific card first through a plot event before it becomes available. Sora can create and store three different decks in the pause menu. Unlike Sora, Riku has a closed deck that cannot be customized. The cards in his deck change depending on the world in which he is traveling. Riku is limited to mainly physical attacks, enemy cards and Mickey Mouse ally cards. He can activate ""dark mode"" and unlock his sleight attacks if he accumulates enough ""dark points"". Dark points are earned by breaking enemy cards and combos, and the difference between Riku's card or combo and the enemy's card or combo is how many dark points he will accumulate for that card break.[10]

Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land|Hoshi no Kirby: Yume no Izumi DeluxeJP,Yes (SPM),2002,HAL Laboratory,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL, AUS",NaN,"Like its predecessor Kirby's Dream Land (1992), Kirby's Adventure is a 2D side-scrolling platform game.[1][2] In the game's scenario, an evil entity named Nightmare corrupts the Fountain of Dreams,[3] which provides restful sleep to the residents of Dream Land. King Dedede steals the Star Rod that powers the fountain and gives pieces of it to his friends[4] in an effort to stop Nightmare.[3] Kirby, the player character of the single-player game, mistakenly believes that Dedede stole the rod for evil and sets out to reunite the pieces.[3][5] When Kirby defeats Dedede and returns the rod to the fountain, Nightmare goes into outer space to spread bad dreams, but Kirby follows him and uses the rod's power to defeat him.[6]
Kirby retains his abilities from Kirby's Dream Land:[1] he can walk left or right, crouch, and jump.[7]:13â14 To attack, Kirby inhales enemies or objects and spits them out as star-shaped bullets.[7]:16â17 He can also fly by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, but he can exhale at any time, releasing a puff of air that cancels his flight and can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.[7]:15 New moves include the abilities to run at a fast pace and to perform a sliding kick.[8]:17 A major aspect of the game is Kirby's copy abilities.[2] By inhaling and swallowing certain enemies, Kirby will obtain powers based on the special ability the enemy possessed.[9] Copy abilities allow Kirby to access new areas and experience levels in different ways.[9][10] Certain copy abilities can only be used a limited number of times. Kirby can discard his ability at any time or lose it when he is hit by an enemy; he must reacquire it quickly or it will disappear.[7]:20

The game consists of forty-one levels across seven worlds,[2] each containing a lobby with doors leading to four to five regular levels, a boss fight, and a Warp Star door which enables Kirby to travel back to previous worlds.[7]:11 Most worlds also contain minigames[1][b] which allow Kirby to gain extra lives,[7]:23 museums where Kirby may easily gain certain powers, and arenas where Kirby must battle with a miniboss to win health and allow him to copy the boss's special ability.[7]:30 The game automatically saves the player's progress after each level.[7]:25 The objective of each main level is simply to reach its end. If Kirby touches an enemy or a dangerous object, he will lose a section of his health meter. If all of his health is lost or he falls off the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. Losing all lives results in a game over.[7]:21 Kirby can touch or eat food items to replenish health or gain temporary invulnerability.[1]"
Kirby & the Amazing Mirror|Hoshi no Kirby: Kagami no DaimeikyuuJP,"Yes (COOP, SPM)",2004,Flagship Dimps HAL Laboratory Arika,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL, AUS","There is a Mirror World that exists in the skies of Dream Land. It is a world where any wish reflected in the mirror will come true, and in it lay the Amazing Mirror. However, one day it copied the mind of a mysterious figure called Dark Mind and created a reflected world of evil. Meta Knight noticed this and flew up to save the Mirror World.
Meanwhile, Kirby is taking a walk when Dark Meta Knight appears. Before Kirby can react, Dark Meta Knight slices Kirby in four and Kirby becomes four different colored ""Kirbies"". They chase after Dark Meta Knight on a Warp Star simultaneously and enter the Mirror World.
The two Meta Knights fought each other until the real Meta Knight is defeated. He is then knocked into the mirror, which is then cut into eight fragments by Dark Meta Knight (which are then scattered across the Mirror World), so the Kirbies must save Meta Knight and the Mirror World.  After collecting all eight mirror fragments, Kirby enters the Mirror World and battles Dark Meta Knight. After defeating him, a vortex appears and sucks the Kirbies in, who is given Meta Knight's sword. The Kirbies then proceeds to fight Dark Mind, the true mastermind behind the Mirror World's corruption, multiple times. Upon defeat, the Mirror World is saved, and Shadow Kirby (the Mirror World counterpart of Kirby who is believed to be an enemy, now ally) waves his goodbyes to the four Kirbies as they all exit the Mirror World via mirror door.
","Unlike the other Kirby games, Kirby & The Amazing Mirror features a maze layout, and is traversed in a style similar to the Metroid and Castlevania games. The game map branches out in several directions and, providing Kirby has the proper power at his disposal, he is able to go anywhere in almost any order, excluding the final sequence. If the player gains access to all mirrors (excluding the one the player is collecting shards for), they will be able to access a new mirror full of Copy Pedestals for their use.
The player explores the worlds, solving puzzles, defeating enemies, and collecting items. Occasionally, a sub-boss will be encountered, at which point the screen will lock into place until the boss is defeated. Swallowing a sub-boss after defeat usually grants a rare or exclusive copy ability. At the end of worlds 2-9 is a boss which the player must defeat to place another shard in the broken mirror in the Mirror Room.  Before each boss is an antechamber where there is no music, for dramatic effect. The player respawns there and there are usually items hidden around it for healing before the fight as well as copy pedestals. The player will also occasionally encounter ""rest areas"" of sorts, where the music reverts to the music from the Mirror Room. There is usually an item and a copy pedestal or two in these areas as well. Some rest areas are part of a system linking back to the Mirror Room, and can be connected via giant buttons that are usually in the room itself, but are occasionally somewhere else in the world.
The player can collect various items to improve in-game performance, such as extra health points and lives, food to replenish health, and batteries for the Cellphone. The game also features two other collectibles: music sheets, which act as a sound test mode once the music player item is found, and spray paint, which can be used to recolor the player's Kirby. Both can be accessed from the main menu. There are also three minigames accessible from the menu, which support single player and multiplayer:
The game also features multiplayer, and the player can call other players or CPU-controlled Kirbys to the location with an in-game cell phone. The three other Kirbys are CPUs by default, but connecting to another GBA (which must also have an ""Amazing Mirror"" cartridge in it) allows for co-op multiplayer for enhanced teamwork and faster completion. There are several new powers in The Amazing Mirror, such as Cupid (called Angel in the Japanese version), which allows Kirby to fly around with wings and a halo and fire arrows; Missile, which turns Kirby into a missile that can be guided in any direction and will explode on contact with a wall or an enemy or when the B button is hit; and Smash, which gives Kirby the abilities he had in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Also, in this version, Kirby's ability to inhale various things has been expanded upon- now able to move or inhale larger objects by holding down the button until his mouth expands, increasing his inhaling power.

Klax / Marble Madness,,2005,Frame Studios Interactive,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, which can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and deposit them either in the playing area (which can hold 25 blocks in a 5X5 arrangement) or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. An uncaught block is considered a ""drop"". A flashing block can be used as a wildcard on any colour. In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by arranging three or more of the same color into a continuous line, known as a ""Klax."" The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (e.g., one vertical and horizontal) counts as multiple Klaxes, as do Klaxes of four same-colored blocks (two Klaxes) or five same-colored blocks (three Klaxes). Once the goal is reached, bonus points are awarded for remaining blocks on the conveyor belt and device, and empty spaces in the bin (also, on levels where a certain point total is required, points in excess of the required amount are counted both in the scoring and as bonus points).[citation needed]
Klax consists of 100 levels grouped into blocks of five. At the beginning of the game and after each fifth level (levels divisible by five, except for Levels 95 and 100), a player can choose to skip five or ten levels. Skipping levels gives bonus points and a higher drop allowance. The game ends when the player either exhausts their drop allowance, fills up their playing area, or finishes level 100.[citation needed]

Klonoa Heroes: Densetsu no Star Medal,,2002,Namco,Namco,JP,NaN,"Taking a unique twist on the normal gameplay of the Klonoa handheld games, Klonoa Heroes instead relies on the player moving Klonoa, Guntz, or Pango across the screen from a top-down perspective, having them defeat enemies and earn experience points in the form of Dream Shards (small, crystal-like objects) and gold, which is used for currency, along the way.  Klonoa once again utilizes his familiar weapon, the Wind Ring, but this time the ""wind bullet"" he can fire from it can be either blue or red.  Guntz's handguns and Pango's bombs work the same way.  Characters can acquire different weapons throughout the game.  Likewise, each enemy in the game is given a color affinity of either blue or red, and Klonoa (or the other characters) can deal more damage to them by attacking with the same color.
Restorative items can be either found in chests located sporadically throughout each level, or purchased from merchants in town.  These items, when used, restore a portion of the character's hit points, as well as provide other small benefits.  Characters can also ""level up"", which allows the player to place points of their choice in different statistics: such as attack power, defense, and agility.  You can change the number of points attributed to each stat at any time (when not in a section of a  level).
Klonoa and his friends must travel through eight worlds separated into several small levels called visions.  At the end of each world, the characters must take on a boss monster, a much more difficult encounter than usual, in order to advance.

Klonoa: Empire of Dreams|Kaze no Klonoa: Yumemiru TeikokuJP,,2001,"Namco, Now Production",Namco,"NA, JP, PAL","Klonoa: Empire of Dreams is a side-story to the main console series, and follows the adventures of Klonoa after he mysteriously awakens one morning in the Empire of Jillius and is dragged by the emperor's royal guards to his throne room for seemingly no reason. Emperor Jillius himself informs Klonoa that he broke the sacred law of his kingdom by dreaming, which he views as a worthless endeavor and a total waste of time. The Emperor himself suffers from insomnia, and decrees that if he cannot be allowed to dream, then no one can. Rather than punish Klonoa outright, he instead offers him a challenge: defeat the four great monsters that are wreaking havoc on the land, and he will be set free.  Joined by his friend Huepow, Klonoa has no choice but to travel to the surrounding lands and do battle with the monsters living there, hoping to earn his freedom and bring peace to the kingdom at last. As they defeat the monsters, Klonoa and Huepow become suspicious that someone is using people's dreams for their own ends, as the monsters are in fact transformed versions of various people from each region (including Chipple). Once the duo figure out the culprit is at the imperial castle, they engage Jillius in a fight and manage to defeat him. Only afterwards it is revealed that Jillius' minister, Bagoo, was behind everything. Bagoo, revealing himself to be the King of Despair, explains that through Jillius he had orchestrated a master plan to create his own kingdom of stolen dreams, even if it meant turning all dreamers in the empire into monsters. Klonoa and Huepow manage to destroy him and Jillius afterwards seems to die in Klonoa's arms. It all turns out to be a dream that Jillius himself had had and he decides that to give his people their dreams and to protect them as well is his real purpose, thus remaking his empire into the Empire of Dreams.
","Klonoa: Empire of Dreams works like a typical 2D sidescroller with the player moving Klonoa left or right on a scrolling screen while defeating enemies using his ""wind bullet"", a special ring that can shoot a small gust of wind forward and draw an enemy in, allowing Klonoa to lift them over his head.  From this position, he can either throw them straight forward like a projectile, taking out any enemy they hit, or he can perform a double-jump, allowing him to reach places he couldn't normally.  In addition to enemies, Klonoa can also pick up large square blocks and place them wherever the player chooses.  By holding the jump button after Klonoa has left the ground, Klonoa flaps his ears and can float in mid-air for a short duration, which also somewhat increases his jumping height.
The game is progressed by finding the exit to a stage after collecting three stars within the level.  Other items like crystals and hearts can be collected in addition, and 1-up items (resembling Klonoa's hat) are usually hidden within a level as well.  Hearts can also be found to increase Klonoa's health.

Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament|Kaze no Klonoa G2: Dream Champ TournamentJP,,"2002, 2005",Namco Now Production,Namco,"NA, JP",NaN,"As the third handheld Klonoa game, Dream Champ Tournament plays very similarly to the rest of the games in the series.  Using traditional platformer elements, the player can move Klonoa left and right, moving the screen forward as they progress.  To defeat enemies, Klonoa will have to use his special weapon, the Wind Bullet, to pull them towards him so he can pick them up.  From this position, he can either toss them forward to defeat other enemies, or use them to perform a double-jump to reach places he couldn't normally.  In addition, by holding the jump button, Klonoa can flap his large ears to float in place for a short time, which also somewhat increases his jump height or distance.
The game consists of five worlds split into nine small levels called ""visions"", including a boss level where Klonoa must compete in a foot-race with another adventurer and battle a boss at the same time.  One vision is also devoted to a special stage where Klonoa must navigate his hoverboard over water or other terrain while avoiding enemies.
In each vision, there a number of items Klonoa can collect, including exactly 3 stars (Moon Stones), 30 crystals-like objects called ""Dream Shards"", and one sun-shaped item called a ""Sun Stone"".  The three stars are needed to open the exit door at the end of each vision, but the remaining items are optional.  By collecting all 30 Dream Shards, a section of a piece of original artwork is revealed (5 in all, one for each world).  If every Sun Stone in the game is collected by the time the player beats it, special stages called ""EX Stages"" will become available.  Beating these new stages has no bearing on the actual game, and are included just for fun.
Klonoa must find the exit to all the visions in each of the five worlds to beat the game, and must race his current opponent at the last vision of each world.

Due to stormy seas and large rocks, the lifeboat containing Jack, Carl, Ann, Hayes (Evan Parke), and Briggs smashes into a chunk of rocks, killing Briggs.
Hayes shoots out a distress signal, causing Englehorn to come looking for them via the ship's plane and drop ammo supplies for them. The group, after fighting off giant crabs, head onto a rocky outcrop. Carl suggests shooting some test shots for his movie, asking Ann to scream. Her classic damsel-in-distress style wailing is answered by a loud roar. The party progresses forward, meeting up with the second lifeboat containing Preston (Colin Hanks), Jimmy (Jamie Bell) and Lumpy (Andy Serkis), although it cannot land because of the strong current of the sea. The team continue traversing the island, battling with many vicious creatures, and are eventually forced to split up. After a huge battle with Megapedes and Scorpiopedes through a seemingly abandoned village, Jack and Ann are captured by the island natives.
Jack is tied to a stake, and watches helplessly as Ann is taken by Kong, a 25-foot (7.6Â m) gorilla during a native sacrifice. Carl saves Jack and the two give chase. During the dangerous journey through the jungle, they have an encounter with Venatosaurus who are feasting on a dead Ferrucutus. Jack and Carl reunite with Hayes after defeating a pack of Venatosaurus with a .45 caliber Thompson submachine gun. Soon after, they find Preston, Lumpy, Jimmy and Baxter, who are crossing a bridge, but they are attacked by a Vastatosaurus rex. Lumpy is torn apart, Jimmy and Baxter fall down into the ravine, but Preston gets to the other side. Jack is separated from Carl and Hayes, who tell him to continue looking for Ann. Jack eventually finds Ann, but she is kidnapped by a Terapusmordax. Kong comes to the rescue and saves Ann. Jack continues on into the canyon, where he sees a migrating herd of Brontosaurus, and also battles Megapedes and Scorpio-Pedes. A V. rex attacks the sauropods and Jack meets up with Carl and Hayes, and continue on their path. In the jungle, they save Jimmy, who is being attacked by the Venatosaurs. They eventually get on a raft, where Jimmy tells the group that everyone else is dead. After escaping the Skull Islanders, the team are pursued by two V. rexes. Kong battles and kills them. As the team continue their journey, they enter a swamp, and fight against Udusaurs. After leaving the swamp, Kong interrupts their log crossing and tips them into a gorge. Carl's camera is broken and he gives up, heading downstream towards the Venture. Jack, Jimmy and Hayes continue their pursuit of Ann.
Jack eventually saves Ann from a V. rex, and the party attempt to find a long stretch of water of which Englehorn's seaplane can land on. After fighting off some Venatosaurus and a juvenile V. rex in a cave, and leaving a swamp, they finally come across a long stretch of water. Englehorn lands on the water, but is forced to take flight as a V. rex arrives on the scene and chases the group. Ann signals for Kong to come. Eventually, Kong comes to the rescue while Jack shoots some Terapusmordax to distract the carnivore. As Hayes tries to stop the fight, opening fire on Kong, the V. rex charges at Kong and inadvertently steps on Hayes, injuring him. Jack and Jimmy stand over Hayes, who tells Jimmy before he dies to get back to the ship. Jack and Jimmy fight many raptors and head back to the stretch of water and find the seaplane. Jimmy leaves with Englehorn and Jack climbs up into the mountains to save Ann.
Jack discovers Kong's lair and kills two juvenile V. rexes and the Skin-Birds roosting above the entrance. He rescues Ann while Kong fights several cave serpents. After leaving the jungle, Ann is captured by the natives once again but Kong saves her. He then heads for the shore where he gets gassed by sailors. He eventually passes out and is taken to New York City, where he is put on display on Broadway. Kong escapes and rampages New York destroying many army trucks. He eventually finds Ann and takes her up the Empire State Building. He tries to destroy a swarm of biplanes but is eventually shot down. Carl stands beside Kong's body and says ""It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty that killed the Beast.""
An alternate ending is possible. This ending can be unlocked by gamers when they replay through various maps and earn a total of 250,000 points. If the player defeats enough biplanes as Kong, the army will light up searchlights on the building so that the biplanes can get clearer shots at Kong, causing Jack and Englehorn to appear in the Venture's seaplane. The player will switch to Jack piloting the seaplane and destroying the searchlights, and shooting down the remaining biplanes to save Kong. Although emergency searchlights are set up, Kong climbs down the Empire State Building. Kong is taken back aboard the Venture and is safely returned to Skull Island. Ann and Jack (or Englehorn) on board the seaplane fly around Kong's lair to see Kong one last time to bid farewell to him, as Kong roars triumphantly. The seaplane returns to the departing Venture.
","In the game, the player assumes the roles of both New York scriptwriter Jack Driscoll and the giant gorilla, King Kong, as they struggle to survive the threats of Skull Island in 1933.
Human levels are controlled from a first person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a heads-up display: it lacks a life bar, aiming reticle, and ammunition readout (the ammo readout and aiming reticule can be turned on and off at the player's will, but is disabled by default), further adding to the challenge and encouraging the player to find alternate weapons and techniques.[2]
Interspersed with human adventure are levels in which the player controls Kong himself, traversing Skull Island's unique geography, battling various giant monsters while defending Ann. The Kong levels take place in a third-person view, as the player directs Kong to punch, grab and use objects/corpses as weapons. He can also bite, climb, charge, hurl enemies and even pound his chest to go into fury mode.[3] When Kong is sent into fury mode, the sky becomes tinted with a golden hue and Kong becomes more powerful and less vulnerable to attack.[4] Many of the Kong sequences fulfill the role of boss fights, as the giant ape is able to effectively battle the gigantic creatures that Jack's weapons cannot harm.[3]
The game features an alternate ending where Kong can be saved during the Empire State Building shootout and safely returned to Skull Island. The ending was approved by Peter Jackson.[5] To unlock the alternate ending, players must complete the entire game and then go back and play through various maps and earn a total of 250,000 points.[6] It can also be accessed by using the cheat codes.

Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu!,No,2002,"Mobile21, Nintendo R&D2",Nintendo,JP,NaN,"In Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu!, the basic strategy is to first fill the screen with colored blocks called Panechus and then make them disappear by making a group of Panechus in one color come together to fill up the bomb meter. Then combine the bombs into mega bombs to blow up the screen big time. The bomb meter is the blue dotted field in the bottom right. When you make Panechus disappear, you get black spots in this field, which will be turned into bombs the next time you press A. Try to make long combos for higher bomb scores. A combo is when you make Panechus disappear in a row without interruption. You can hear how good you're doing by the shouts from the Panechus as they disappear. For some instances, a 1 combo will make them say ""HAPPY"", a 2+ combo will make them say ""SO HAPPY"", a 6+ combo will make them say ""MEGA HAPPY"" and so on. You can see at the top of the bomb meter how many bonus bomb points you get (1+, 2+, 3+, 5+ etc.). If the field gets filled up a ""DANGER!!"" alert will come up, and you get 10 seconds to clear things up or it is game over.
There are five different play modes to choose from.
It is possible to reverse the tilt sensor to be able to properly play it on a GBA SP.
In the menu, go to ""option"" (rightmost green panechu) then choose the blue ""tilt sensitivity"" one.
On this screen, press and hold first UP, then L, then R, and finally B.
After this, you should get a confirmation message accompanied by a little chime.
You might want to reconfigure your sensitivity back to where it was since pressing up changed it.

"Kunio-kun Nekketsu Collection 1
Nekketsu KÅkÅ Dodgeball Bu
Nekketsu Street Basket",,2005,"Million Co., Ltd.",Atlus,JP,NaN,"The NES version of Super Dodge Ball expands upon the basic premise of the original arcade version by giving the members of each team individual names and stats. Moreover, in addition to the single-player tournament mode and a 2-player versus mode, there's also a free-for-all ""bean ball"" mode where the six members of Team USA fight each other until one remains.
The objective of each match is to defeat the rival team by throwing a dodge ball at its members. Each character has a life gauge that is gradually depleted as he gets struck by dodge balls. When their life reaches zero, they will be eliminated. When a character gets hit, with a life gauge of three bars or lower, they will be placed in a ""tired"" state, giving the opponent a moment of advantage. Moreover, each has their own stats and two different power shots (one which is performed while running, and another that is performed during a running jump).
World Cup play is the game's single-player mode. The player takes control of Team USA, as they compete against eight rival teams in a dodgeball tournament with irregular rules. To win each match, the player must defeat the three infield members of the rival team. However, if the three infield members of the player's team are defeated, the player will lose the match.
Like in the arcade version, the player starts off in a match against another rival American team and then proceed to face against seven international teams. The eighth match is against Team USSR. If the player loses at least one of their members during the match with USSR, the game will end after USSR is defeated. However, if all three infield members are still alive, an additional match set in Team USSR's home court will be held against Team Shadow, a clone of Team USA whose members will be arranged in the same positions as the player's.
The home courts of Team Iceland's and Team Kenya's are different from those of the other teams. Iceland's court is a slippery field of ice, whereas Kenya's court is a swampland that makes it hard to run.
Versus play is the 2-player competitive mode. Both players can choose from any of the nine teams from the World Cup mode, including the same team as the other player. While both players can change the formation of their teams before each match, there's only one fixed court in this mode. The rules in each match are the same as in World Cup play.
Bean ball mode is a free-for-all mode that can be played by one or two players. The player can choose from one of the six members of Team USA. The members who are not chosen by the player (or players) will be controlled by the computer instead. In this mode, each member of Team USA must fight each other on a schoolyard until only one remains. Unlike the courts of the other game modes, there is no infield or outfield and all six characters can move in any place they want.
The background of the schoolyard changes depending on the difficulty setting: on Easy, it is set during the day; on Normal, it is evening; and on Difficult, it is nighttime.

Kururin is initially unsure that he is up to the task because he has never left his home world before. Being the adventurous and helpful fellow he is, Kururin agrees to rescue his lost family. Teacher Hare trains Kururin in the art of controlling the Helirin, a stick-shaped helicopter that has a slow-spinning propeller. Piloting the Helirin through the different worlds will be a difficult task, but using Teacher Hare's valuable lessons, Kururin bravely sets out on his adventure to rescue his lost family.
","The player controls a slowly spinning stick called the Helirin, or the Helicopter in the European localization, and must maneuver it through a series of mazes without touching the walls. The player controls the direction and speed of movement (there are 3 levels of speed), but the task is made difficult as the stick rotates continuously. The Helirin can move faster by holding down any of the two face buttons, and even faster by holding down both. There are bonuses to collect, record times to beat, and a gold star for completing the level without any accidents. The game also features multiplayer support, which enables four players to participate in the action using a single cartridge.
Kuru Kuru Kururin was released in Japan and Europe, but not (until early 2016) in North America. However, as the Game Boy Advance has no regional lockout, a North American Game Boy Advance can be used to play either the Japanese or European version of the game. The menus in the Japanese version are simple enough that they are easily navigable by a player who knows no Japanese.
The game starts with simple training levels, in which players are told how to play and how to get around the first corners. After that, there are three levels in each stage, which get progressively harder and longer. The obstacles and the look of the levels (ice, cave, machine, etc.) vary between stages. Beginners can play the levels on Easy mode, where the stick is only half of its usual size.
There is a mode called Challenge mode, which is a collection of smaller levels, usually involving only one or two corners or objects to dodge.

Lady Sia,No,2001,RFX Interactive,TDK Mediactive,"NA, PAL","Onimen, a powerful warlock, found ancient magic in the continent of Callyge. He used the magic to create a race of half-human/half-beasts known as the T'soas. Using huge turtles to transport his new army over the sea, he invaded the continent of Athorre, the human kingdom, and quickly took control. The remaining realms did not know how to react and their leaders forsook their military alliances. The only one convinced of the need to act was the young Queen of Myriade, Lady Sia.
The story starts with Sia having called the leaders of the remaining realms together in the meeting room of her castle. She tries to convince them of the danger of the situation, but she doesn't succeed.[6] Sia is then informed by her advisor, Barthes, that a T'soa horde is near her castle. She quickly leaves the meeting room to check the situation. She, however, is ambushed and locked away in a cell of Athorre's castle. She is awoken and freed by a mysterious, cloaked man who gives her some advice and information before running off. Now alone, Sia soon finds a new ally in a chained griffin[7] in another part of the castle. As a way of thanking her for freeing him, the bird offers to aid Sia in her quest by bringing her wherever she wants to go.[6] Sia first goes search for her jade sword and family magic ring, which are two powerful artifacts stolen from her by the T'soas.
Before going home to save her own kingdom, Sia decides to visit the leaders of the other realms to check on their current alliance statuses and, if necessary, restore old ones. The other leaders, Poseidon of the Water Kingdom, Rafooza of the Fire Kingdom and her sister, Cheyenne, the queen of the Air Kingdom, had gone home after Sia failed to return to the meeting room.[6] Sia manages to convince each of them to join in the battle against the T'soas and Onimen.
Back in Myriade, Sia finds her kingdom completely taken over by the T'soas. Furious, she visits the important locations of her kingdom to free them from the T'soas and save what is left. Eventually, she comes face to face with one of Onimen's most powerful minions, known as the Fox Lady. Sia defeats the Fox Lady and thereby frees her land from the T'soas.
Having restored her own army and her alliances with the other realms, Sia goes on ahead to prepare a safe passage for the armies. She discovers the turtles the T'soas used to cross the sea and frees them so the armies of the alliance can use them to reach Callyge. After this, she infiltrates Callyge's fortifications on her own and ends up in a battle with Onimen. The battle ends undecided: Onimen transforms into a demon-like creature and flies away. That night, the kingdoms celebrate they've won the war. The leaders on the other hand, have a meeting to decide what to do with the T'soas now that their king and creator, Onimen, is gone. Sia proposes to make peace, as Onimen was the real enemy and not the T'soas.[6] Before they can have a real discussion about the matter, the cloaked stranger that helped Sia escape from Athorre's castle appears. He offers to govern the T'soas for them. Sia is surprised to see him again, but is willing to accept the offer. After telling the others what the stranger did for her, they agree as well.[6]
Lady Sia takes place in an unnamed fantasy world. Gameplay takes place in the three continents involved in the war, each of which are separated by seas. Two of these continents serve as kingdoms. The continent of Athorre is the kingdom of humans. These humans do not possess magic, but have a good understanding of technology and city construction. Athorre is the first realm attacked by the T'soas. By the time Sia starts her quest, the kingdom has been completely taken over. The T'soas use Athorre's castle jail to imprison Sia and the village Algambiade and the city Merrion to hide Sia's sword and ring. Northeast of Athorre lies an unnamed continent that contains multiple kingdoms. The elemental kingdoms are located in the northern part of the continent. Present in the game are the Water Kingdom, the Fire Kingdom and the Air Kingdom. It appears that an Earth Kingdom was planned,[8] but eventually not implemented. Each kingdom is ruled by a monarch who is capable of powerful magic. Sia's kingdom, Myriade, is separated from the elemental realms by the Snowy Mountain and located in the southern part of the continent. Myriade's inhabitants appear well-versed in magic.[6] The continent of Callyge is located in the northeast of the map and is the T'soas' and Onimen's headquarters. Seaports protect Callyge from attacks.[6]
","Lady Sia is a traditional platformer with action-adventure elements. As such, players have to watch out for numerous enemies as well as make sure not to fall off of the platforms.[1] The world Sia must cross is divided into four areas, each of which are divided into four levels, a main boss fight, and a bonus level.[1] Levels focus on either fighting or acrobatics. Sia has three lives per level, but the player can temporarily acquire more by collecting gems. If the player loses a life, he or she must restart at the beginning of the level or at the last checkpoint. Checkpoints are found halfway through each level and usually depicted as golden whirlwind images that turn into an image of Sia when activated. If all lives are lost, Sia is ""thrown in jail"" and the player receives ten seconds to decide whether to restart the level or quit.
A perfect score on a level is 100 points: five points per health point, one point per magic point, one point per collectible gem, and five points per freed prisoner.[2] Getting a perfect score for each of one area's four levels grants access to the bonus level.[3] In addition, Sia must prove her worth to the other leaders in the first three levels of the second area by battling two of them and racing a third. Sia's status after these boss battles has no effect on her score for that level. Defeating the main boss in each level grants access to the next area. All levels and boss battles can be replayed as many times as desired.[1]
Sia is a capable warrior blessed with several magical abilities. The primary form of combat is melee sword combat. Players fight with an average sword in the first level, but can get Sia's jade sword back in the second level. The jade sword is a more powerful weapon, allows the player to use the three combo moves,[4] and automatically replaces the weaker original sword. Sia's magical abilities are mostly used for ranged combat. During the first level, her magical abilities are limited to shooting small balls of energy in one of eight directions. In the third level, Sia regains her family's magic ring. This item allows the player to charge an energy ball before releasing it so that it becomes more powerful. Completing the first three levels of the second area adds three more spells to the repertory.[4] The Water Spell is a defensive spell and makes Sia invulnerable for ten seconds. The Fire Spell creates an explosion that hits every enemy on the screen and damages them, killing only the weakest. The Air Spell hits only the closest enemy, but is guaranteed to kill it in one hit.[2] Sia's final magical ability is shapeshifting. As a shapeshifter, she has the ability to turn into a ""sasquatch"". The game does not allow the player to do this at will; Sia's sasquatch form can only be used when she automatically shapeshifts during three of the four main boss battles.[5] In this form Sia can no longer use magic and must rely on melee combat again, but becomes much stronger with more melee combat abilities. These new abilities include ground pound, shield, and dash.

The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,,2006,Krome Studios,Vivendi Games,"NA, PAL","The game begins inside a temple, where a large red dragon named Ignitus is watching over an egg; it is the ""Year of the Dragon"" (not to be confused with the third Spyro game), a time every twelve years when new dragon eggs are brought to the realm. A dragons' prophecy tells that every ten generations, a rare purple dragon will be born, who will direct the fate of that era; Ignitus is looking after such an egg.
The dragons are, however, at war with an enemy known as the ""Dark Master"", who also knows of the prophecy, and lays siege to the temple, intent on destroying the brood of eggs. Ignitus escapes with the purple dragon's egg, leaving it to drift downriver into a swamp, hoping for the best.  The egg is discovered by a family of dragonflies, and upon hatching, they name the dragon Spyro and adopt him into the family and raise him as one of their own, alongside Sparx, a dragonfly born the same day.
One day, after coming under attack by strange foes and discovering that he can breathe fire, Spyro is told that he is not a dragonfly himself but a stranger from a distant land; Spyro decides to leave the swamp in search of his true home; Sparx, though reluctant at first, decides to follow along.  Spyro is pursued by hostile forces, but eventually comes into contact with a distraught Ignitus, who although pleased that Spyro is alive, fears that with the Dragon Temple under occupation by their enemy, led by a black female dragon named Cynder their war is already lost.
Spyro convinces Ignitus to lead him to the Temple, and is able to drive Cynder's forces out, after which Ignitus tells Spyro more about their war against the dark armies, offers Spyro some training in the art of the fire element, and then sends Spyro off to rescue three other dragons from Cynder's forces.  One by one, Spyro clashes with Cynder's armies, rescues the three other dragons, Volteer, Cyril, and Terrador, while acquiring new skills and training along the way.  It is learned that Cynder has been draining the dragons' power into crystals.
Cynder, however, starts fighting Spyro who shortly after rescues the final Dragon Guardian, Terrador; Ignitus intervenes to fight Cynder but is captured.  It is revealed that it was the four dragons who originally sealed away the Dark Master, and that Cynder is using the dragons' drained powers to open the seal.  Ignitus's power is the final key in unsealing the Dark Master, so Spyro is sent on a final, direct assault against Cynder's fortress.
Spyro attempts to fight Cynder, but Cynder succeeds in draining Ignitus's power of fire into a crystal, and escapes to the sealed realm of the Dark Master. During the fight, Spyro had noticed there was something familiar in Cynder's eyes. Ignitus then tells Spyro the rest of the story of what happened the night of the attack on the temple. After sending Spyro's egg down the river, Ignitus had returned to see that the Dark Master's forces had destroyed the brood of eggs, except one - for only a dragon born in the Year of the Dragon can open the portal and release the Dark Master: Cynder, who had been transformed by the Dark Master's sinister powers. Ignitus fears that it is too late to stop her, but Spyro pursues Cynder and forces a showdown, eventually using all of his power in a final attack which defeats her, purging her of the Dark Master's influence and returning her to her true form, a young dragoness the same size and age as Spyro. The realm begins to collapse in on itself; Sparx insists on making a quick exit but Spyro declares he will not leave Cynder behind with the Dark Master; though barely, Spyro is able to grab Cynder and escape safely.
Though victorious, the battle cost Spyro much of his own strength and powers, and both Spyro and Cynder suspect that the Dark Master is still alive somewhere; the war is still far from over. The story continues in The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night.
","A New Beginning uses a more action-based focus than previous Spyro games. Rather than the previous focus on platforming, the gameplay is now more combat based. Spyro has a variety of combat moves as well as four different breath attacks: fire, electricity, ice and earth, which he can use as both long range and short range attacks. Spyro can also use furies, huge blasts of elemental energy. The game has fewer levels than previous Spyro games, with six levels that progress from a starting point towards a final destination and boss encounter in a linear fashion, and two rail shooter style flying levels adjoining them. It takes about six hours to complete the game.
The DS version has additional attacks and challenges. As well as breath attacks and furies, Spyro can create an elemental shield around himself that protects him from enemies while hurting attacking enemies. Also, the DS version has extra side missions in the form of puzzles.

The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night,,2007,Amaze Entertainment,Vivendi Games,"NA, PAL","The story continues with Spyro following Cynder through the swamp surrounding the Dragon Temple. Spyro catches up with her and asks her not to leave. Cynder says she's sorry for what she had done in the previous game and wishes to find out where she belongs in the world, currently believing that she does not belong at the temple. She runs off, leaving Sparx and Spyro alone. Soon after she is gone, the Temple is attacked by the apes. After Spyro repels the attack, Ignitus, the leader of the dragons and master of fire, sends Spyro to seek out a tree that Spyro saw in a vision (in the dreams to follow, he gets his powers back, as he lost them at the end in A New Beginning) while Ignitus looks for help against the Apes. As Spyro searches for the tree, he also searches for another dragon known as the Chronicler, who asked Spyro in the same vision to find him. When he finds the tree (in the Game Boy Advance version, he falls into a cave), it suddenly turns into a tree monster known as Arborick (the Game Boy Advance version calls the monster Naga) and attacks Spyro, but although Arborick was killed, Spyro is captured by pirates, and is taken on board their ship to take part in gladiatorial combat.
After Spyro defeats a third enemy in the arena, he is made to fight Cynder, whom the pirates captured as well. Before they can think of a plan to escape together, the pirate ship is suddenly attacked by the apes, who capture Cynder. After Spyro escapes the ship and defeats the pirate captain, Skabb. He discovers that the Apes have established a base on the Mountain of Malefor, also known as the Well Of Souls, in an effort to revive the Dark Master using a lunar alignment called the Night of Eternal Darkness. He also discovers that they are keeping Cynder prisoner hoping to turn her to their side.
Spyro eventually finds the Chronicler, who tells him about the Dark Master. According to him, the Dark Master was the first purple dragon; his raw power allowed him to master practically every elemental power. When his growth failed to stop, he was exiled and sealed away by the dragon elders, but not before he taught the Apes how to use dragon magic. The Chronicler wants Spyro to hide from the Dark Master until a later time, but Spyro insists on going to Cynder's aid.
When he gets to the mountain, Gaul, the Ape King, orders Cynder to attack Spyro. When she attacks Gaul instead, he knocks her out and challenges Spyro himself. During the fight, the lunar alignment occurs, and the evil energy it generates is channeled through Spyro, which turns him into his dark self.  He uses his immense power to turn Gaul to stone then blast his body apart, killing him, then leaps back into the beam of evil energy. Cynder awakens and knocks Spyro out of the beam, freeing him from the beam's power. When the alignment passes, the mountain begins to crumble around Spyro, Sparx, and Cynder. Remembering the Chronicler's words about riding out the storm, Spyro uses his powers to encase himself, Cynder, and Sparx in crystal to protect them as the Well of Souls collapses. After the credits, the trio are shown in the crystal while someone is watching as the Chronicler says that when Spyro awakens, the world would be different, but also assures him that he is not alone; he has allies. The story concludes in the final game Dawn of the Dragon.
","The gameplay is similar to its predecessor. Spyro must travel to the end of a level in a linear fashion and defeat the boss at the end of each level, defeating enemies with his combat moves. However, there is a much larger emphasis on exploration and puzzle-solving.
Spyro will learn different breaths from the Chronicler, who is met in Dreams which occur to Spyro during the course of the game. The breaths are tools for defeating enemies. They come in different elements; fire, ice, electricity and earth. Spyro can also use furies, which are big blasts of elemental magic. Spyro is required to obtain a certain amount of purple gems to be able to use these skills.
Spyro is able to learn the skill of ""dragon time"" from the Chronicler. This skill allows Spyro to slow down time. He can use this ability to jump on platforms which are too fast to land on with his normal speed. He can also use this ability to defeat enemies more easily.
Throughout the levels there are forty quills. Each quill collected gives the player 5 pieces of concept art.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords|Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce & Yotsu no TsurugiJP,Yes,2003,Nintendo,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL","The intro to A Link to the Past reveals the back story of the game, showing that series antagonist Ganon was sealed away after his bid for the Triforce. However, the seal has grown weak, and a wizard named Agahnim has taken over the throne of Hyrule, and is kidnapping the seven descendants of the Sages who sealed away Ganon, which includes Princess Zelda. The game opens with series protagonist Link receiving a message from Zelda, telling him to come save her. Following his Uncle, he finds him near death, and is tasked by his Uncle to find and rescue Zelda, giving him his sword and shield before dying. After Link reaches the dungeons, he frees Zelda from her cage, and takes her through a hidden sewer into a Sanctuary, where she remains hidden. The man in the Sanctuary tells Link of Agahnim's plan to break the seal the Sages placed, requiring Link to obtain the Master Sword. Link travels across Hyrule, aided by a man named Sahasrahla, collecting three pendants from the three dungeons, using them to unseal the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. Link returns to Hyrule Castle with the Master Sword after Zelda is kidnapped. When he meets Agahnim, he finds that he is too late, as Agahnim teleports her away.
After battling and defeating Agahnim, he takes Link into the Sacred Realm, which has been corrupted and transformed into the Dark World by Ganon. He is tasked with rescuing the seven Maidens who have been sealed away in crystals, as well as finding magical items called the Silver Arrows. Link eventually rescues Zelda, and uses the Maidens' power to break into Ganon's Tower. After fighting and defeating Agahnim for the second time, Ganon flies from Agahnim's corpse into the Pyramid of Power. Link follows, doing battle with him. He eventually defeats Ganon, and finds the Triforce. After the Triforce speaks to Link, Link uses it to wish for Hyrule to return to normal. Afterward, he returns the Master Sword to where he found it. If the player has completed Four Swords, they may find an alternate ending by beating a secret dungeon. This dungeon features four Dark Links, in reference to the four Links in the Four Swords game. After defeating them, an ending showing the inhabitants of the Dark World and the various bosses is shown.
Taking place before the events of Ocarina of Time, the prologue shows Link and Zelda approaching a sword in a pedestal, called the Four Sword. After Zelda explains its history and the creature sealed within it, the creature named Vaati breaks free, capturing Zelda to marry her. Link is encountered by three fairies who instruct Link to pull the Four Sword out. Link pulls the Four Sword out, inadvertently creating three copies of himself that fight alongside him. As the game begins, the four Links are tasked with finding four Great Fairies, who together will grant them access to Vaati's palace. After finding the four Great Fairies and entering the palace the Links battle Vaati. After Vaati is thoroughly weakened, he is trapped in the Four Sword. Zelda and Link return the Four Sword back in its pedestal.
","The gameplay of A Link to the Past has changed very little from the original 1991 release; only slight modifications have been made. The game is an overhead adventure game, with the primary means of fighting and defending being a sword and shield. The sword can do a variety of things, including a sword spin, an energy projectile, and a secret technique introduced in the Game Boy Advance version called the Hurricane Spin. Link collects a variety of different equipment throughout his adventure, featuring series mainstay items such as bombs, a bow, the boomerang, and a lamp. It introduces the Hookshot, the Magic Mirror, and the Pegasus Boots. Link's health is measured in heart containers, which can be replenished by collecting smaller hearts from enemies and bushes. Link has a magic meter from which some of his items derive power; for example, the Lamp uses some magic meter to light torches. There are two kinds of area â the overworld and the dungeons. The overworld has varying locations, including buildings that house these several dungeons. These dungeons have a set of objectives and items. Dungeons feature a number of keys, one single big key, a dungeon item, a compass, and a dungeon map. The overworld changes drastically when players enter the Dark World, a distorted alternate version of the original overworld. Players may go back and forth using both the Magic Mirror, which allows access to the Light World from the Dark World, and portals scattered across both worlds.
Creating a file for the Game Boy Advance game will give players a profile in both A Link to the Past and Four Swords. A Link to the Past is single-player, but Four Swords is for 2â4 players. Some features in the two games are linked. For example, when players learn a new sword move, it is transferred between games. Once everyone is connected, Player 1 chooses one of the four basic stages to play on. The gameplay is similar to A Link to the Past, though it is cooperative in that stages require teamwork to complete. All dungeons are randomized before play.
Four Swords is the multiplayer portion of the cartridge. Four Swords features gameplay similar to A Link to the Past, with a focus on multiplayer; in it, two to four players must cooperatively work through a series of puzzle-laden dungeons, while competing to collect rupees. The player with the most rupees at the end of a level wins a special prize, though all rupees are shared together in the long run. All players are given respective colors â player one is green, player two is red, player three is blue, and player four is purple. Once all players are connected, player one chooses one of the four stages available to play on. All dungeons are randomized before play. The dungeons have three levels to them, with a portal at the end of each level; the first to reach it will be rewarded with a Heart Container, an item that increases the player's health meter. The third level is not a traditional dungeon, but rather a boss battle. Once defeated, they will return to the hub area.
Unlike in A Link to the Past where Link may have an inventory of items he has collected, Four Swords only allows a player to have one item at any given time, switching them out at item pedestals. An original item called the Gnat Hat appears, causing Link to shrink and be able to access areas he could not normally reach. This was featured in a later game The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, though it was in the form of a talking hat named Ezlo. Some features in this game are linked with A Link to the Past. For example, when players learn a new sword move, it is transferred between games. Another link between the two games is that, when both are beaten, players may access a dungeon called ""Palace of the Four Sword"" in A Link to the Past.

The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap|Zeruda no Densetsu Fushigi no BÅshiJP,No,2004,Capcom,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The Minish Cap retains the general gameplay features that were present in previous Zelda installments.[6] The main protagonist, Link, must navigate several dungeons to obtain an item or enhancement at the end of each dungeon that is pivotal towards the quest. Each of the game's ""bosses"" are defeated using the item acquired in the boss's dungeon. The game also includes multiple ""side quests""âoptional tasks that are not part of the main quest but offer rewards for completion that are beneficial to the player.[7] Recurring characters in the Zelda series make appearances and some form part of side quests; for example, Tingle and his brothers must all be contacted by the player to earn a reward.[8]
A gameplay mechanic original to Minish Cap is the ability for Link to transform into ""Minish size"" by using one of the many ""Minish portals"" scattered across Hyrule. While in Minish size, Link is the size of the tiny Minish race. This changes perspective on the way the player can interact with the world, and requires them to shift from Minish size to human size in order to navigate the environment, avoid obstacles, and solve puzzles. For example, to ""Minish Link"" squares of tall grass are giant walls, and shallow puddles are giant lakes, whereas small structures are entire temples and cracks in the ground that ""Human Link"" can only walk over are holes that ""Minish Link"" can drop down. Enemies that would otherwise be easy to defeat also become dangerous ""giant"" counterparts, such as a regular ChuChu, which is the boss of the first dungeon and is fought while Link is in Minish size. The game's overworld is a map of the kingdom of Hyrule, and at its center is ""Hyrule Town"". The town acts as the player's main ""safe space"" from the monster-infested overworld, allowing them to collect rupees, gather equipment, play games at entertainment establishments to gain prizes, begin and progress side-quests, and interact with the citizens. Throughout the game's various story and side quests, Hyrule Town is also utilized as an on-and-off ""dungeon"" of sorts that Link must navigate interchangeably in his human and Minish size.[9]
The Minish Cap features a number of enhancements that benefit from the more powerful Game Boy Advance platform.[10] The game's camera angle is much closer to the ground, allowing more detail. In the overworld and in dungeons, the game replaces the traditional item interface of the handheld Zelda games with pictures associating items or actions with buttons,[11] similar to the item interface in 3D titles like Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker. Enemies include familiar creatures from the Zelda universe.[6] Link can also perform special actions present in the 3D Zelda games, such as rolling while running.[12] Along with returning items such as Bombs, Arrows and Pegasus Boots, The Minish Cap introduces three new items: the Mole Mitts, the Gust Jar, and the Cane of Pacci. The Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt barriers to explore new areas, the Gust Jar can suck in nearby items and substances and can be used to suck up certain enemies and fire them as projectiles, and the Cane of Pacci can flip certain objects over and allow Link to launch himself out of holes in the ground.[13] The game advances the combat system from previous handheld installments by allowing Link to learn new sword techniques throughout the game, some of which are techniques from previous games and some of which are new.[14] As the game progresses, Link will collect Elements that fuse with his sword, allowing him to make copies of himself using glowing floor panels, used to solve puzzles such as pushing large blocks or hitting multiple switches simultaneously.
Kinstones are special artifacts which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion that are found throughout the course of the game. If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters.[15] While many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.[16]
The Minish Cap also features a figurine-based sidequest, similar to that in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.[17] The player can collect ""Mysterious Shells"" like those found in hidden areas in Link's Awakening, which sometimes appear when defeating enemies and can also be found or bought in different locations throughout the world. These can then be used in a gashapon-like machine in Hyrule Town to obtain figurines of characters, enemies or locations that Link has encountered in the course of the main quest. New figurines only become available once Link has met or killed the subject of that figurine. Each figurine has a short description revealing information about the game, that particular enemy's weaknesses, or the series in general. Collecting every figurine unlocks a house in Hyrule Town that contains treasure, a Piece of Heart, and the Sound Test.[18]

Note that the world region is only available after completion of all the American territories. Each territory has between 8-12 storylines chosen at random with a push of a button. Certain storylines may not be available based on the wrestler used by the player. For example, if the player uses Jerry Lawler, the only storyline he can play in the Southeast region is based on the famous feud Lawler had with comedian Andy Kaufman.

Prior to the start of the game, the color of the head, arms, and legs of the playable character can be customized.[3] The player controls Takua, a villager on the island of Mata Nui. As Takua, the player has access to a range of abilities: jumping, throwing objects, pushing stones, and using tools.[5] The player can choose which tools to equip and assign them to the button of their choice in the pause menu.[6] Health and item uses can be replenished by gathering fruit and berries scattered across the world, and some fruit can be used as projectiles.[4] Projectiles are the primary method of defeating the enemies, which populate the game's worlds.[5]

Lego Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge,,2001,Silicon Dreams,Lego Software,"NA, PAL","The game immediately casts the players as Pepper Roni, the pizza delivery boy of Lego Island. The Infomaniac informs him that the people of Lego Island are donating bricks to build his new house for him, but first he must deliver pizzas to them. When Pepper delivers the pizzas and has his house built, Papa Brickolini calls him for one last pizza delivery job. Pepper must deliver a pizza to the Brickster in jail. Upon arrival, Pepper learns the Brickster has been saving peppers from the previous pizzas, so he can eat them all at once and melt the jail bars with his fiery breath.
The Brickster then steals the police helicopter and the Constructopedia, the book with all instructions to the buildings on Lego Island. With each page he tears from the book, a building becomes deconstructed and the pieces fly into the air. The main plot of the game starts here, where Pepper must travel three different worlds to collect all the pages and rebuild Lego Island. The Brickster releases his ""Brickster Bots,"" robotic minions that taunt and terrorize the people of Lego Island. Pepper uses pizzas to break them down. For every Constructopedia page Pepper finds, a building is restored. After finding four pages on the Island and dealing with the Brickster Bots in the Information Center, Pepper must travel to Castle Island by boat.
On Castle Island, Pepper must rebuild the bridge between the Lions and the Bulls, two kingdoms on separate halves of the island. Pepper dives down the river and avoids obstacles such as sharks, firing cannons, a giant squid, and skeleton pirates. He rebuilds the bridges and collects a Constructopedia page. After that, Pepper must joust the Dark Knight in order to get the Bulls' flag from the Lions. The stubborn Bull leader, Cedric the Bull, is adamant about giving Pepper the page. Pepper must blow up all the Bulls' cannons using his own, while also dodging cannonballs from Cedric. Upon his defeat, Cedric surrenders the page and the Castle Island stage of the game is complete.
Several more pages are found on Lego Island after returning. Pepper also collects a boombox used to defeat the Brickster Bots (since pizzas no longer hurt them). Shortly thereafter, Pepper is told he must go to Adventurers' Island via helicopter. He lands in the desert and meets classic Lego characters Johnny Thunder and Pippin Reed. On their way to the Sphinx, Pepper must prevent snakes from stealing the Adventurers' gems by using a cannon in the back of the Scorpion Tracker. At the Sphinx, they meet Dr. Kilroy, who agrees to let Pepper use his Speedster to get to the Oasis. Pepper must open sarcophagi to match symbols and open the gate to obtain a page. A boulder is triggered and rolls towards Pepper towards the exit. Pepper then gets into Dr. Kilroy's Speedster and avoids rocks, trees, cows, tornadoes, and UFOs on the way to the Oasis. At the Oasis, Pepper fishes for a fish called Big Bertha, who swallowed one of the pages. At the airfield, Dr. Kilroy has succumbed to heat exposure. Pepper must fly the biplane to the jungle, while the three Adventurers fly in the seaplane.
At the jungle, Pepper rides a T-Rex to the infamous Mr. Hates' camp. Mr. Hates has a page. Pepper frees all of Mr. Hates' dinosaurs that he has captured and retrieves a page. The Adventurers Island part of the game is complete, and all of the pages have been returned to the Island.
Upon returning to Lego Island, Pepper begins training to go into Space, as reports indicate the Brickster has settled on Planet Ogel â ""Lego"" spelled backwards. Pepper trains for centrifugal force and parachute emergency. During space travel, Pepper dodges asteroids and finds that the Brickster has stolen the landing gear. He must jump out of the shuttle and parachute onto Ogel Island.
On Ogel, Pepper makes pizzas with Mama and Papa Brickolini, whom the Brickster has taken captive. The pizzas put the citizens of Ogel to sleep so Pepper can face the Brickster. He climbs the tower, avoiding moving platforms and gaps. At the top of his tower, Pepper must throw spicy pizzas at the Brickster whilst dodging Brickster Bots. When the Brickster eats three pizzas, he goes to the bathroom sink for water and locks himself in, effectively jailing him again. Pepper and the Brickolinis return to Lego Island.
While the game is mostly made up of mini-games, the player can explore each Island in-depth to retrieve trinkets scattered around the map to boost their score. Castle Island has chalices, Adventurers Island has red gems, and Ogel Island has yellow crystals.

Lego Knights' Kingdom,,2004,Razorback Developments,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Knights' Kingdom is a top-down perspective action-adventure game for the Game Boy Advance. The player controls one of four characters, with only one character being controlled at a time. The character run through a series of nine levels, attacking Shadow Knights and solving tasks along the way. The player collects shields in levels as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's health will deteriorate. Upon dying, the player will fall back onto the ground.
The game also includes a tournament arena mode, where the characters compete against each other in three modes: Hand to Hand Combat, Jousting and Sword Lightning Combat.
In tournament mode, the player can play as one of five knights from the Knight's Kingdom action figure line: Jayko, a blue-armored knight with a hawk crest; Danju, a purple-armored knight with a wolf crest; Rascus, a green-armored knight with a monkey crest; Santis, a red-armored knight with a bear crest; and Lord Vladek, the black-armored antagonist who bears a scorpion crest.[2] Vladek, unlike the other knights, must be manually unlocked.

Lego Racers 2,Yes,2001,Pocket Studios,Lego Media,"NA, PAL","The main mode of the game is a single-player open-world adventure game featuring a galaxy of five worlds: Sandy Bay, Dino Island, Mars, the Arctic, and Xalax. Sandy Bay is a green landscape featuring two beaches and a small town. Dino Island is a jungle island featuring a large continuous area of grass and trees in the middle and a lava building featuring circular spiral that leads to an exit at the top. Mars is the planet Mars. The Arctic is a cold, snowy and icey world and Xalax is a large circular arena featuring an open blue world in the middle and, around it, a cyan-colored circular track and a large ecstatic crowd. Except for Sandy Bay, each world contains four races against five casual AI drivers from that world, a final boss race and a lobby connecting all five races. Each world also contains one or two bonus games. When entering any world for the first time, the player builds his own car or chooses between Sparky's pre-built cars for that world. The player then drives around each world using their car for that world to access and enter all activities. To gain access to new worlds, the player must collect golden bricks by winning non-boss races and finding hidden golden bricks in each world. Each non-boss race has three laps while each boss race has two laps (the final race has three). The game features a player assistant named Sparky, who guides, advices and supports the player and allows the player to save the game and explore each world to find golden bricks and bonus games. By beating bosses and winning bonus games, the player collects car power-ups that make their car faster, more stable on the ground or more resistant to taking damage. Dino Island's boss is Sam Sanister, a reincarnation of Baron von Barron from Lego Racers, who has a fast car and lays oil on the ground that causes the player to slip out of control. The Mars boss is Riegel's large self-built walking robot which is indestructible and is unaffected by attacks and the Arctic boss is The Berg, a gorilla-looking ice creature who runs and is also indestructible and unaffected by attacks and lays ice ridges on the ground that send the player's car into the air and slow it down. The Berg gets a head start.
The player builds his Lego character and starts in the middle of Sandy Bay, the main world, which features take-off points to travel to each of the other worlds, provided that the player has collected enough golden bricks for that world. The player drives down to the nearby beach and meets Sparky who asks the player to go back to town. When the player arrives, they join a circle of four other drivers from that world â Workman Fred, Mike the Postman, Fireman Gavin, and Police Chief Bobby â who have a heated discussion about who is the fastest racer on Sandy Bay. Each of the four challengers insists that they are the fastest driver. Fred is repeatedly laughed at by the remaining four drivers when the idea of a digger ever winning a race is ridiculed by Gavin and the player. Fred asks the player to come to his construction site to race him, confident of winning to the point of awarding the player a golden brick if he loses. After beating him, the player goes to and races Mike, then after defeating him, they race Gavin, and finally Bobby. After defeating all four challengers on Sandy Bay, the player heads off to Dino Island to win the four pre-boss races and then beat the boss there, Sam Sanister. The player then completes the races at Mars and Arctic. 
The player then enters the portal leading to the fifth and final world, Xalax. After winning the four races in the open world, the player takes on Rocket Racer â the reigning galactic racing champion who has the fastest car in the galaxy â on the cyan oval track. When the player wins the race, the player's character walks up the stairs of a tall small construction in the middle of the arena and receives the championship trophy from Rocket Racer and shows it off to the crowd. The character then goes back down and is surrounded by Sparky, the four challengers from Sandy Bay and the three other bosses who celebrate and praise the new galactic racing champion. The final race is then re-played automatically. When the player also has collected all 35 golden bricks, the player can observe fireworks in the sky in the middle of Sandy Bay.
","Unlike the original Lego Racers, the player has more ""freedom"", because the player can race or drive freely, and there are other characters that the player can talk to. Lego Racers 2 also has, like in the original, a car and characters designer. It has more bricks but fewer characters to make and edit. In Lego Racers 2, up to 11 opponents can be chosen. In any race, the racers have to drive through a set of checkpoints each lap in the correct order. There are four different weapons that can be used to damage the opponentsâ cars, as well as an invisibility shield. The player gets these weapons and the shield by collecting bubbles which randomly assign the player an item, assuming the player doesn't have one already. On each track there is a pair of pink fences which any racer can drive in-between to repair their car, partially or completely depending on the amount of damage and how much time is spent there. If a vehicle gets destroyed, the character is forced to run slowly on foot until the character enters a repair station and gains back their vehicle.

Lego Star Wars: The Video Game,Yes (COOP),2005,Griptonite Games,Eidos Interactive,"NA, PAL, JP","The plot of the game is a humorous retelling of Star Wars: Episode I â The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II â Attack of the Clones, and Star Wars: Episode III â Revenge of the Sith, as well as a bonus level with the opening of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope from the viewpoint of Darth Vader aboard the Tantive IV.
","Gameplay in Lego Star Wars is geared towards family play, and does not feature a game-over scenario. Given a specific set of characters in each scenario, based on a scene from each of the movies, up to two players can control them, using their different abilities. By walking up to another friendly character, the player can switch control over to that character; this interaction is necessary in order to use another character's abilities to complete certain puzzles. Lego Studs, small coin-like collectibles which serve as the game's currency, can be collected by finding them, smashing or using the force on certain objects, or defeating enemies. Studs increase in value based on color, silver is the least valuable at only 10 points, going up to gold, valued at 100 points, blue at 1000, and the rarest, purple worth 10,000. Players also have a health meter consisting of four hearts that gets depleted if they get injured or shot at. When they lose all their hearts, their character is broken apart and they lose studs (as opposed to lives). These studs can be spent on unlocking new characters for Free Play mode, hints for playing the game, and cheats. Certain segments of the game feature players controlling spaceships flying on a flat plane. There are also several minikit canisters hidden throughout each level that, when collected, combine to form a vehicle.
When the player first starts the game, they must first complete Chapter I of The Phantom Menace (""Negotiations""). However, once that Chapter is completed, the player may choose to play any unlocked levels from the other two movies in their desired order.
Completing all the game's levels with full stud bars will unlock an additional chapter based on the opening scene of A New Hope, which features a 'prototype' Darth Vader, who uses Anakin's fighting style, and a Stormtrooper whose movements are identical to the Clone Troopers (both of these are remodeled in the next game).
The background music is the same music used in the Star Wars movies, but as the game was released before Episode III's soundtrack, music from the original trilogy (1977, 1980 and 1983) was used for that movie's levels. For instance, the alternate soundtrack for the ""Binary Sunset"" was used in the second Chapter of Episode III, while ""The Battle of Endor I"" was used in Chapter VI, ""Princess Leia's Theme"" for chapter V and ""The Battle of Yavin"" was used in Chapters 1 and 3. In The Complete Saga, the tracks that played during gameplay of that episode were replaced with ones from Episode III, although the original trilogy music remained in that episode's cutscenes.
Lego Star Wars contains a total of 59 playable characters for LEGO Star Wars; 56 in the GameCube, PS2, Xbox, and PC versions. The three missing are Gungan, Tusken Raider, and STAP, playable in the GBA version, though the Gungan and STAP are only available through cheat codes. The playable characters are modeled like actual Lego parts and, on dying, they fall to pieces and also lose studs. There is a wide variety of characters included in the game, all of which are unlocked by completing levels or by purchasing them at Dexter's Diner. Characters are divided into groups according to certain skills. For instance, Jedi and Sith can double-jump, use lightsabers, and have control of The Force, which they can use to activate or lift Lego objects or defeat certain enemies. Darth Maul has a double-ended lightsaber which improves his defence from laser fire. Jar Jar Binks, General Grievous and his bodyguard have the super-jump, which allows them to reach obstacles that the Jedi and Sith can not jump to. Characters like PadmÃ© Amidala and clone troopers, who carry blasters, have the ability to grapple to reach higher places. Droids, while unarmed, can travel through the game without being intentionally attacked by enemy characters. Protocol droids and astromech droids can open special doors. Characters such as Boba Fett and Young Anakin can fit into tight places. Every character, other than the PK Droid, Gonk Droid (whose only ability is that they are never killed by enemies), and Chancellor Palpatine, has a special ability.
Unlocked characters can be imported into the game's sequel, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, as an extra called ""use old save"", which costs 250,000 Lego Studs, and can be used in its character creator function.
Because the game is based on the Prequel Trilogy (1999, 2002, 2005), Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian and other characters from the original Star Wars Trilogy (1977, 1980 and 1983) are not shown, and appear in the sequel Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. However, if the player unlocks the last level (an episode 4 preview), Darth Vader, a stormtrooper, a rebel trooper and Princess Leia become available. Original trilogy characters Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are unlockable in the game since they appear in the prequel trilogy also.
Once a non-vehicle level has been cleared in Story Mode, the player may play through that level again in Free Play Mode. In this mode, players can choose to play through the level with their choice of unlocked characters randomly selected by the program based on their abilities. At any point, the player can rotate instantly between each of the chosen characters to access areas not accessible during the Story Mode and obtain hidden extras. No story cut scenes appear in this mode.
Dexter's Diner is the area where the player chooses what level to enter, or they can enter the Parking Lot to view any vehicles whose parts they have found and pieced together. The parts to these vehicles are contained in 10 mini-kit canisters which are hidden throughout each level. Battles often take place in the Parking Lot between canon-good and canon-evil characters, such as Jedi and Sith, respectively. At the diner counter, the player may purchase, or enter codes, to unlock extras in exchange for Lego studs they have collected by playing through the levels.
The Game Boy Advance version behaves differently than the console versions.  It is played from an isometric perspective with only one player, who controls one of 15 playable characters through story scenarios across the prequel trilogy, battling enemies, completing objectives and getting from one place to another.  The levels are not evenly divided across the three Episodes, with Episode II having the fewest levels.  Each level is divided into multiple sections that serve as checkpoints should the player's character fall apart, and players are given a longer health meter that they must prevent from depleting to continue.  Each character possesses a special ability that is constrained by a stamina meter not found in the console version.  Players can also find Jawas in certain levels who can award the player health or stamina upgrades, as well as a maintenance droid that can save them once from death once at the price of currently collected studs in a level.  All boss battles are primarily against villains with lightsabers, and call for heavy button mashing to win, especially when players can exclusively get caught in lightsaber blade locks that must be won to inflict extra damage.  Other characters have different attack abilities that are not in the console versions, such as blaster-wielding characters able to fire charged shots and astromech droids being able to drop proton mines that would damage enemies on contact.  Players are also encouraged to use other characters' abilities in free-play to discover secret areas and find Death Star plans, which replace minikits in the console version.  At the end of each level, players are rewarded and ranked for how many enemies they defeated, how many blaster bolts they deflected, how many studs they collected and how many Death Star plans they found.

Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,No,2006,Amaze Entertainment,LucasArts,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Lego Star Wars II's gameplay is from a third-person perspective, and takes place in a 3D game world that contains objects, environments, and characters designed to resemble Lego pieces. Its gameplayâa combination of the action-adventure, platform,[3] and sometimes puzzle[4] genresâshares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005).[3] While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue.[5][6][7][8] The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possesses specific weapons and abilities.[9] At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller.[5] During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs â small, disk-shaped objects, which serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted, the player dies, and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.[5]
The game's central location is the Mos Eisley cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine.[5] At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes.[10][11] In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles.[12] The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina;[9] each film is represented by six levels,[13] representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor.[9] The game also features bonus levels.[13] During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks,[9] and drives vehicles.[14] Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play-offers all those unlocked.[9] Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.[2]
Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle.[15] When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick.[16] Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available.[15] The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.[16]
68 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game,[17][18] including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO,[19] Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok,[20] and Boba Fett.[21] Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars.[22] Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force.[21][23] R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open particular doors.[24] Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects.[25] Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects.[21] Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force,[17] Princess Leia possesses a slap attack,[8] and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack.[26] Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities. This means that some secrets can be found only in free play mode.[27] The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play;[17][18] however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.[13]
Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley cantina.[5][9] These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters;[28] 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible.[17][29] Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available.[30] The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.[28]

Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,,2004,Griptonite Games,Activision,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The core gameplay consists of elements of a platformer, a puzzle game, and a third-person shooter. The player assumes the role of either of the three Baudelaire orphans, and can cycle through them depending on the version.
The Baudelaires can eventually gain access to a multitude of inventions as well as ammunition throughout the game, which are mostly those that tend to run along the lines of things a child might actually attain, such as rotten eggs, bubble gum, bees, eau de toilette, and garlic, among other things.
The three console versions have the same basic layout - players can switch between playing as Violet, Klaus and, at certain moments, Sunny. The game begins at Count Olaf's house, then progresses to Justice Strauss' home, back to Olaf's, then to Uncle Monty's house, then Damocles Dock, then Aunt Josephine's house, Curdled Cave and, finally, Olaf's again. Along the way, Violet invents things - Klaus's weapon â the Brilliant Bopper; her own weapons â the Fruit Flinger, the Reptile Retriever, and the Peppermint Popper; the Baby Booster, which helps Sunny jump; the Steady Stilts, which help Violet reach high places; the Uplifting Umbrella, which helps Violet glide across gaps; the Horrifying Hook, which Klaus uses as a grapple gun; and the Levitating Loafers, which can make Klaus levitate for a brief period of time. In the game, the heroes solve puzzles, fight Count Olaf's theater troupe, and collect puzzle pieces with the familiar eye throughout the series. If the player collects 25 of each color puzzle piece, a place is revealed in their secret folder, which in turn reveals a picture where they can find a V.F.D package. This package reveals a special extra in the game, such as a making of featurette. Completing the game will also unlock the World Map, a sandbox mode allowing players to roam around the various levels and collect more puzzle pieces and packages.
The Game Boy Advance (GBA) version is different in that players can switch between all three Baudelaires at all times. The game also features more places, such as Briny Beach. It is said to be more difficult than the console versions. In The Reptile Room level, some reptiles are mentioned that never appear in the books. Also, there are fewer inventions but have the same effects as the other games, such as the Parasol Glider, which helps Sunny glide from platform to platform; the Water Pump, which helps Klaus spray and absorb water; the Grappling Hook, which helps Klaus swing from platform to platform; and the Apple Cobbler, which helps Violet shoot apples. Players must collect objects that Violet or Klaus mentions to make the inventions. Players must also talk to other characters to complete some quests or grab items that other characters are holding.
The player must collect pictures and butterflies for invention upgrades, movie scenes, and concept art. They must also collect book pages to use on specific places to either give you extras, keep going on the story, or makes it easier to get around.
The Microsoft Windows version has several differences from the console games. For one, players cannot switch between characters. The game keeps the player as one character, switching to another when necessary, and even separates the older Baudelaire siblings at times. Secondly, there are two new environments, Briny Beach and a horseradish factory (presumably the one that is discussed in The Reptile Room, The Grim Grotto, Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography and The End). Finally, players have different inventions to make; the Smasher, the Lobber (which uses rotten eggs, bubble gum, horseradish, water balloons, and bananas as ammo), the Lockpick, the Sprayer (which uses eau du toilette, onions, pillow feathers, bees, and limes as ammo), the Lever Yanker, the Reptile Retriever, stilts, and a Grappling Hook. As a bonus, players can collect eyes; every ten eyes collected gives the player a poster for an Olaf theater production, and letters from the alphabet which start a word that is then defined. Some of the words, such as Quagmire, referring to the Quagmire triplets and Xenophobe, referring to a word Jerome Squalor mentioned to the Baudelaires in The Ersatz Elevator are from the books.

Lode Runner,,2003,,Success,JP,NaN,"The player controls a stick figure who must collect all the gold in a level while avoiding guards who try to catch the player. After collecting all the gold, the player must reach the top of the screen to reach the next level. There are 150 levels in the game which progressively challenge players' problem-solving abilities or reaction times.[10]
Levels feature a multi-story, brick platform motif, with ladders and suspended hand-to-hand bars that offer multiple ways to travel throughout. The player can dig holes into floors to temporarily trap guards and may safely walk atop trapped guards. Should a guard be carrying a bar of gold when he falls into a hole it will be left behind, and can be retrieved by the player. Over time, floors dug into will regenerate, filling in these holes. A trapped guard who cannot escape a hole before it fills is consumed, immediately respawning in a random location at the top of the level. Unlike guards, the player's character may not climb up out of a hole, and will be killed if it fills before he can escape by other means. Floors may contain trapdoors, through which the player and guards will fall, and bedrock, through which the player cannot dig.
The player can dig a hole only to either side and not directly underneath himself. This introduces a strategy for when digging a hole x blocks deep, the player must first dig a gap at least x wide to be able to dig through it, as the number of spaces will shrink with each layer, since the player must himself occupy one space, and needs at least one free space adjacent to himself to be able to dig. However, exceptions to this rule arise when the player digs from the position of standing on a ladder, or hanging from a hand-to-hand bar, which allows the player to repeatedly dig and descend one row. This kind of digging is involved in solving many of the levels.
The player starts with five lives; each level completion awards an extra life. Should a guard catch the player, one life is subtracted, and the current level restarts. The player's character can fall from arbitrary heights without any injury but cannot jump, and players can trap themselves in pits from which the only escape is to abort the level, costing a life, and begin again.
The guards do not always take the shortest path to the player, but can also move in counterintuitive ways. Sometimes, when the player and a guard are on the same ladder, for instance, the guard will move away from the player. In general, depending on their exact positioning relative to Lode Runner, the guards sometimes appear to be repelled. Mastering the game involves developing the intuition to predict the movement of the guards.
The player may come into contact with a guard directly from above, with the stick figure's feet touching the guard's head. This is what enables the player to walk over guards who are temporarily stuck in a hole that has been dug. It is also possible to make this contact while both the guard and the player are in free fall, since the player not only runs faster than the guards, but also falls faster; moreover, it is possible to survive the feet-to-head contact while a guard is standing on a platform and begins to move. Both forms of contact are necessary to solve some levels. Sometimes it is necessary to liberate a trapped guard by digging while standing on his head, but then moving rapidly in the opposite direction when the guard begins marching to freedom. In a few levels, it is necessary to use a falling guard as a bridge to reach an otherwise unreachable area. One subtlety is that if a down movement is initiated while standing on a guard's head, or briefly touching the guard's head during free fall, the consequences are fatal.
In some levels, guards can be deliberately trapped in various ways. For instance, they can be lured into entering a part of the level from which there is no escape. In some situations, the player can liberate trapped guards by digging them out. In some levels, to collect some gold pieces, the player must exploit the guards into collecting gold pieces, because they are positioned such that whichever figure collects them will become trapped. When the guard collects the piece and becomes trapped, the player can release the guard and then later steal the gold when the guard drops it or falls into a hole.
In some levels, there are gold pieces which can be collected only by killing guards by trapping them in dug holes which close up. Deceased guards come back to life from locations near the top of the screen, which may allow them to reach parts of the level that cannot be reached by the player.
Some levels require careful ordering of traversal, because they are divided into zones connected by passages which are impossible to traverse in the reverse direction. If a gold piece remains in an unreachable zone, the player may have to abort the level to start again, losing a life, unless there is a way to coax a guard into bringing the gold.
Some of the game's puzzles in the advanced levels are time-sensitive. The player must dig in order to penetrate the interior of some cavern to collect gold, and quickly return the same way before the digging repairs itself, enclosing Lode Runner in that cavern with no means of escape.
Some puzzles require deliberate timing among the digging actions because Lode Runner must run over previously dug-out tiles that have just repaired themselves, while having enough time to pass through ones which have not yet repaired.

Each character has their own unique special abilities and the game requires using both characters. Along the way, money is found all over the place, usually as coins and bills. Gold bar are also found but rarely. Coins are worth $5, bills are worth $50, and gold is worth $100. Some items are buried in the ground.  The money is used to access any of 4 other regions in the game such as Vegas or Paris.  Each character can take 3 hits.  Upon the third hit, they return to the last checkpoint.  There is an unlimited number of lives. Bugs Bunny has the special abilities of digging and double-jumping. Daffy Duck has the special abilities of fluttering and swimming.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,No,2002,Pocket Studios,Black Label Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player controls one of three characters at various points in the game: Frodo Baggins, Aragorn, and Gandalf, each of whom has their own weapons and abilities.[6] Frodo is the only character who can jump, shimmy along ledges and sneak.[7] Only Frodo and Gandalf can push and pull items.[8] Gandalf is the only character who has access to magic. Aragorn has the most health, is physically the strongest character and has more melee combat moves.[9][10]
In combat, Frodo has access to three melee weapons at different stages in the game. Initially, he is armed with a walking stick. Later, he acquires a dagger, and finally, he can use the short sword Sting.[11] Frodo can also throw stones, and can turn invisible for limited periods of time by using the One Ring. Aragorn is initially armed with a basic longsword, but later acquires AndÃºril.[11] He also possesses a bow, and he can kick out at enemies. Gandalf uses his sword Glamdring and has several magical abilities, such as a fire attack, chain lightning and healing.[12] The player can also switch to first-person view at any time during the game. This can help targeting when Frodo is throwing stones or Aragorn is firing arrows. Movement during first-person view is limited to strafing left and right.[13][14]
When playing as Frodo, there are two meters on screen. One represents his health; the other represents his ""purity."" As soon as Frodo puts on the One Ring, he begins to draw the gaze of Sauron, and his purity begins to diminish. If the purity meter empties before he takes the Ring off, he will become corrupted, and the game will end. Once he removes the Ring, the meter will begin to fill again.[15]  Gandalf also has two meters; health and magic spirit. As he uses magic, his spirit meter will begin to deplete. When it is empty, he can no longer cast spells. He can refill the meter by drinking miruvor. Aragorn has only one meter; his health bar.[16]
The game features a number of collectible items. Often, they are quest items necessary for progressing in the story, but occasionally, the player can find health items; mushrooms for Frodo's health, cram bread and lembas for Aragorn and Gandalf, and miruvor for Gandalf's magic spirit.[17] The Xbox version of the game features secret areas in many levels, where special items can be found. The Ring itself helps guide the player to these locations as its on screen image begins to rotate when a player is near such an area; the faster the rotation, the closer the player is to the secret location. The Xbox version also features numerous side-missions absent in the other versions of the game.[10]
The Game Boy Advance version is different from the other three versions insofar as it is more RPG based, and is played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view.[18] Gameplay focuses on turn-based combat, and at various points, all nine members of the fellowship (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir) are controllable, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and growth charts.[19] During combat, the player has the choice to fully control each member of their active party (up to four characters), or instead, control only the main player character, and have the other three controlled by the AI.[20]

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Lord of the Rings: Futatsu no TouJP,Yes (COOP),2002,Griptonite Games,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The Two Towers is a hack and slash action game played from a third-person perspective. The game features levels taken either directly from scenes in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers films, or based closely on elements from the films. For example, the levels during the defense of Helm's Deep are very similar to the corresponding scenes in the film, but a level in Fangorn Forest in which the player fights orcs, Uruk-hai and trolls is original to the game. For most of the game, the player is free to play as Aragorn, Gimli or Legolas. In the game's main opening level, however, set at Weathertop, only Aragorn is playable. Isildur is also a playable character in a tutorial level set during the Battle of the Last Alliance. All subsequent levels can be played with any of the three characters. Often, the two characters not chosen as the player character will appear as supporting NPCs.[8] Upon completing the game with all three characters, the player can play through every level with Isildur. In the Game Boy Advance version, which is played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view, the playable characters are Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Frodo and Ãowyn, with Gimli available as an unlockable character once the player has completed the game with two other characters.[9]
Although all three characters have different weapons and combos, their basic fighting style is the same. Each character has a quick attack which does minimal damage and can be easily blocked, and a fierce attack, which does more damage, but is slower and leaves the player vulnerable to attack. Only fierce attacks can break enemy shields. Each character also has a ranged attack, a ""killing move"" (which can be used to instantly kill downed enemies), a parry (which can deflect enemy attacks), a knock back (which pushes nearby enemies away), a jump back (in which the player character jumps back away from the enemy) and a devastating attack (a charged fierce attack).[10] Combos are an important part of combat, with each character having access to a unique list of combos, which are achieved by stringing specific button presses together.[10] Additionally, each character is more skilled at a particular type of combat; Aragorn is the bestest melee fighter, Legolas is better at ranged combat, and Gimli is a balanced character with nice melee and ranged attacks.[11]
Combos, as well as health increases, and stronger ranged and devastating attacks must be purchased between levels in the skill upgrades screen. During each level, the player will be continually graded on the skill with which they dispatch enemies; ""Fair"", ""Good"", ""Excellent"" and ""Perfect."" The more skill with which the player kills, the more experience they acquire. The player's skill is measured by an on-screen meter which increases as the player dispatches enemies. To avoid the meter dropping back down, the player must avoid being hit, and must kill enemies using a variety of different methods. When a player reaches a Perfect level, all of their attacks increase in strength, and the experience from each kill is doubled. However, Perfect status only lasts for a brief period of time.[12] At the end of each level, the player is then given an overall rating based on their performance, and awarded the corresponding number of upgrade points to spend on new combos and stronger attacks. The better the player has performed during the level, the more upgrade points that will be made available.[13] Certain upgrades only become available for purchase once a player has reached a specific experience level.
In the GBA version, each character has fifteen active and passive skills that can be unlocked and upgraded as the player gains experience. One of the active skills, for example, is ""Summon""; Gandalf summons a Great Eagle, Aragorn summons either Legolas or Gimli; Legolas summons Gimli; Frodo summons Sam, and Ãowyn summons Ãomer. Passive skills include the ability for Aragorn to wield two swords at once, to hit enemies with his shield, and to throw his sword at nearby foes. Legolas can gain a quickdraw skill, as well as the ability to shoot multiple arrows at once. Every time the player increases in level, they can attribute points to strength, accuracy, health, defense, and courage. Additionally, Frodo has the ability to use the One Ring to turn invisible, but he can only do so for a certain amount of time before attracting the attention of Sauron. The game also features co-op multiplayer through the Game Boy link function.[9]

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Lord of the Rings: Ou no KikanJP,Yes,2003,Griptonite Games,EA Games,"NA, PAL, JP","Todd Arnold, senior producer of The Return of the King, stated that the game was not intended to re-tell the story of the film,
but to allow the player to come as close as possible to experiencing the critical parts of the film for themselves. Levels were designed with this goal in mind, with just enough plot to give context to the player's actions.[23] Liberties were thus taken with the plot,[24] and critics noted there was little footage which could spoil the film for those who had not seen it.[16][25] GameSpot's Greg Kasavin said ""if you didn't know anything about the story of The Return of the King, then the story of the game may be hard to follow, though you'll still get the gist of it."" However, he also advised, ""in case you don't want any aspect of the movie spoiled for you, it'd be wise to hold off on playing The Return of the King until after you've seen the movie.""[16]
The game begins during the Battle of the Hornburg at Helm's Deep, with the Uruk-hai having just penetrated the outer walls. With the defenders falling back to the inner court, Gandalf (voiced by Ian McKellen) appears on a hill-top flanked by thousands of Rohirrim. The player takes control of Gandalf as he enters the battle and helps defeat the Uruk-hai and orc army. After this level, the game splits into three separate mission arcs, each with its own individual set of characters. The ""Path of the Wizard"" follows Gandalf, the ""Path of the King"" follows Aragorn (Chris Edgerly), Legolas (Andrew Chaikin) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and the ""Path of the Hobbits"" follows Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), although initially only Sam is playable.[16][26]
The Path of the Wizard continues immediately after the events of the first level. The remains of the Uruk-hai and orc army flee into Fangorn Forest. However, within the forest, the Ents, led by Treebeard, have awoken and joined the fight against Sauron. Gandalf helps the ents as they destroy the rest of the army, and then assists them in bringing down a dam holding back the River Isen. This floods Isengard, trapping Saruman (Christopher Lee), who had joined forces with Sauron, in his tower, Orthanc. Gandalf and Pippin (Billy Boyd) then head to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, leaving Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim to follow them. Gandalf has gone ahead of the others because Sauron mistakenly believes that Pippin has the Ring, and Gandalf plans to use this confusion to distract Sauron as Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum (Andy Serkis) towards Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. In Minas Tirth, Gandalf helps repulse the enemies from the walls for a time, but eventually, they break through the city's defenses. Gandalf and the soldiers of Minas Tirith then retreat to a courtyard, where they must defend the fleeing civilians from the enemy. Once the people are safely inside, Gandalf can do little but await the arrival of Aragorn.
The Path of the King picks up with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim on the way to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the Paths of the Dead in an effort to convince the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the Paths of the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Ãowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Ãowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As it seems they are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.
The Path of the Wizard and Path of the King share the same final level, set at the Black Gate of Mordor. In a further effort to distract Sauron from the approach of Frodo and Sam, Gandalf advises that Aragorn and the remaining army marches to the Gates of Mordor as a direct challenge to Sauron, who will send out a vast army to meet them, thus keeping his attention away from Mount Doom. Upon arriving at the Gate, the party are confronted by the Mouth of Sauron (Roger L. Jackson), who tells them that Frodo is dead. They kill him and must then face a massive army of orcs, before fighting the remaining NazgÃ»l. Not believing Frodo to be dead, they plan to fight as long as they can, ultimately sacrificing themselves so as to give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring.
In The Path of the Hobbits, Frodo, Sam and Gollum must first escape from Osgiliath, fighting past orcs to get to the sewers and ensuring that Frodo is not kidnapped by the NazgÃ»l. However, upon escaping, Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself. He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam, but Sam follows them into Shelob's lair. In the lair, Gollum abandons Frodo, and Sam must fight past giant spiders and orcs, eventually facing Shelob herself, who has attacked Frodo. Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. About to go to Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive and hears them say that Frodo is alive but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting among themselves, and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo. Together, they head to Mount Doom. However, before Frodo can throw the Ring into the lava below, he is attacked by Gollum, who takes the Ring. In the final level, the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum on the edge of the precipice. Frodo successfully defeats Gollum, knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever.
","Described by the developers as a modern version of Gauntlet, The Return of the King is a hack and slash action game played from a third-person perspective.[12] The game is very similar to its predecessor in basic gameplay. Each character has a quick attack which does minimal damage and can be easily blocked, and a fierce attack, which does more damage, but is slower and leaves the player vulnerable to attack. Only fierce attacks can break enemy shields. Each character also has a ranged attack, a ""killing move"" (which can be used to instantly kill downed enemies), a parry (which can deflect enemy attacks), a knock back (which pushes nearby enemies away), a jump back (in which the player character jumps back away from the enemy), a devastating attack (a charged fierce attack) and a special ability.[13] Playable characters in the console and PC versions are Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo and Sam, with Faramir, Pippin and Merry available as unlockable characters. Playable characters in the GBA version are Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo, Gandalf, and Ãowyn, with Gollum and Sam available as unlockable characters.[14][15]
Each playable character has their own set of combos and attributes. After the end of each level the player can upgrade their characters' abilities and combos using experience points. The number of points available to the player depends on the efficiency of their kills.[16] During each level, the player will be continually graded on the skill with which they dispatch enemies; ""Fair"", ""Good"", ""Excellent"" and ""Perfect."" The more skill with which the player kills, the more experience they acquire. The player's skill is measured by an on-screen meter which increases as the player dispatches enemies. To avoid the meter dropping back down, the player must avoid being hit, and kill enemies using a variety of different methods. When a player reaches a Perfect level, all of their attacks increase in strength, and the experience from each kill is doubled. However, Perfect status only lasts for a brief period of time.[17] A new aspect of Return of the King is that at the end of each level, rather than purchasing upgrades for the individual character, the player can also purchase ""Fellowship"" upgrades which apply to every playable character. However, characters will only be able to avail of a particular skill when they have reached the corresponding experience level.[18]
A major change from The Two Towers is the interactive nature of the game environments.[12] The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies.[19][20] The levels are also twice the size of the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear.[19] Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together.[16] The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support,[21] although this was removed from the European version of the game.[22]
The Game Boy Advance version is played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view.[15] A major gameplay difference in this version is the addition of ""runes"" which players can etch into their weapons, granting them special abilities. The game also features co-op multiplayer through the Game Boy link function, and unlockable content when connected to the GameCube version via the GameCube â Game Boy Advance link cable.[14]

The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age|The Lord of the Rings: Nakatsukuni DaisankiJP,Yes,2004,Griptonite Games,EA Games,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"When starting a campaign, the player is prompted to choose a commander from either good (Aragorn, Gandalf or Elrond) or evil (Saruman, the Witch-King of Angmar or the Mouth of Sauron).  Selecting a commander from either side begins a campaign from the perspective of that army. The player can store two saved games at any given time, one each for good and evil.
Depending on the campaign, a number of secondary heroes are available for use in battle.  The good heroes include members of the Fellowship and supporting allies such as Legolas, Gimli, Theoden, Eomer, Eowyn, Faramir and Boromir.  The evil heroes include a variety of orcs and servants of evil from the films and novel trilogy, such as Grima Wormtongue, Gorbag, Sharku, Ugluk, Grishnakh, Lurtz and Gothmog.  As the player completes missions and progresses through the campaign, they are able to use experience points to purchase skills and equipment upgrades in order to enhance the performance of their primary and secondary heroes.  The game may be played on ""Sauron Mode"", whereby heroes who fall in battle are unavailable for the remainder of the campaign.[citation needed]
A number of non-selectable, non-upgradable heroes appear and are playable in certain missions.  In the case of the good campaign, these  include Merry, Pippin, Treebeard, Prince Theodred, and Isildur, as well as unnamed captain units.  On the evil campaign, these additional companions include Orc chieftains and captains, Uruk-hai lieutenants and captains, and in a few select missions, the Dark Lord Sauron. Units known as standard-bearers are also occasionally available to either side and add to the command points on a given flank. 
The campaign comprises 24 levels in addition to two tutorial levels and six bonus missions.  All of the missions in a given episode must be completed to move to the next portion of the trilogy. Several bonus levels and heroes are unlockable by meeting specific conditions while playing the game.[citation needed]

They are able to escape the ship, but get lost in various periods of time. They must traverse various bizarre locations, and eventually confront and defeat Tomator, to find their way home.
","The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform adventure in which the player alternates control of the three Viking characters, guiding each of them one at a time (though control may be swapped from character to character at any point) from a designated start point in each level to the exit. The game offers a two-player cooperative mode in which each player simultaneously controls one Viking and is allowed to change control to the third, unused Viking at any point. Every level is designed such that each Viking must contribute his unique skills to help the other two through to the end. Similarly, to finish the level, all three characters must reach the exit point. The Vikings each have three health points which they can lose by getting hurt by enemies or by falling from great heights. Should any Viking run out of health points, he dies; gameplay will then continue with any remaining Vikings, but the level becomes unwinnable, and the player will eventually have to restart the level and try again. However, the game offers unlimited continues.
Each Viking has the ability to carry and use itemsâsuch as keys, bombs, and food (which restores health points)âas well as a unique set of skills:

Love Hina Advance: Shukufuku no Kane wa Harukana,,2001,Marvelous Entertainment,Marvelous Entertainment,JP,"The story is a shÅnen comedy that takes place in the Kanagawa Prefecture, and centers on KeitarÅ Urashima and his attempts to fulfill a childhood promise that he made with a girl to enter the University of Tokyo together. However, he has forgotten the name of the girl he made the promise to and hopes to be accepted into the university in order to find her. Having failed the entrance exam twice and with his parents no longer willing to support him, he goes to stay at his grandmother's hotel, only to find out that it has been converted into a female-only apartment. The tenants are about to kick him out when his aunt appears and announces that his grandmother has given him the title to the apartments. Much to their dismay KeitarÅ becomes the new manager of the family-owned girls' dorm Hinata House and must now balance his new responsibilities in addition to studying for the university entrance exam.
At Hinata House, KeitarÅ meets Naru Narusegawa, who is also studying to enter the university. Naru ranks first in the whole of Japan on the practice exams, and KeitarÅ convinces her to help him study. As the two of them grow closer through their studies, and after KeitarÅ accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. On the second day of the university exam, KeitarÅ asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the university exams.
After returning from Kyoto, KeitarÅ and Naru decide to retake the exams. After a while, Mutsumi moves to Tokyo, and the three begin to study together. During this period, Naru becomes convinced that Mutsumi is KeitarÅ's promised girl, but Mutsumi states that she made a childhood promise with Naru, not KeitarÅ. During the next round of university exams, KeitarÅ believes he has failed them once again and runs away before finding out his results. After learning of this, Naru chases after him without checking her exam results either, and they are followed by the rest of the residents of Hinata House who announce that KeitarÅ and Naru both passed the exams along with Mutsumi. Unfortunately for him, KeitarÅ has an accident at the University of Tokyo opening ceremony and is unable to attend classes for three months. After recovering from his injuries, KeitarÅ decides to study overseas with Noriyasu Seta. As KeitarÅ is about to leave, Naru finally confesses her feelings to him at the airport and decides to wait for him to return.
When KeitarÅ returns, he and Naru finally begin to express their feelings for each other. After they deal with new obstacles, Grandma Hina returns to Hinata House and reveals Naru is the girl of KeitarÅ's promise. Three years later, a wedding ceremony (with a new girl, Ema Maeda, presented) is held at Hinata House for Naru and KeitarÅ as they finally fulfill their childhood promise to each other.

Lufia: The Ruins of Lore|Estopolis Densetsu: Chinmoku no IsekiJP,Yes (COOP),2002JP2003NA,Atelier Double,TaitoJPAtlusNA,"NA, JP","Lufia: The Ruins of Lore takes place 20 years after the events of Lufia II. After the defeat of the Sinistrals by Maxim, the world has enjoyed a season of relative peace. However, this is threatened when the Kingdom of Gratze, a growing military superpower, allies itself with a mysterious man named Ragule and declared war on its bordering nations. Their primary goal is to scour the world in search of a powerful monster known simply as ""The Beast"", that, once under their control, would all but insure their conquest of the world. The game is told from the perspective of a young man named Eldin, who, during this age of conflict is traveling the world in search of adventure and intrigue. On his journey, he meets a young priestess named Rubius who is searching for mystic shards and stones that will allow her to enter a fabled holy land. One of the places she needs to go to obtain one is Ragule's fortress, and once they arrive, they meet the despot and realize that if the world is ever to be at peace again, he must be stopped at any cost.
","Much like the rest of the Lufia series, The Ruins of Lore plays like a typical role-playing video game, where the player must advance through several scenarios and navigate dangerous dungeons, fighting enemies along the way. Unlike typical computer RPGs, the battles are not random, and the monsters are displayed in the dungeon itself along with the characters. Combat only ensues when they come in contact with each other.
Winning battles grants the player experience points which go toward gaining levels, making the characters stronger in the process, and just like  Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals, several monsters (called ""Disc Monsters"" in this title and caught in battle in a similar manner to PokÃ©mon) can be captured instead of slain and used to fight with the party. The monsters can be fused with Eldin, Torma or Rami for three turns in combat once a character's Installation Points (""IP"") reach their maximum. These points are visible by a gauge just beneath the characters hit points and ability points, and fill up when they are hit by an enemy. In the new merged state, the player loses control of the character but gains two abilities. The first ability is invincibility: while the character is merged with a monster, the character cannot sustain damage or receive status ailments in any way. The second is a special attack (depending on which form the character is using) that may or may not do more damage than the character normally can: this same move is repeated until all three turns pass. Once three turns go by, the character and the monster split and revert to normal. The character cannot merge with its selected monster partner unless it has built up at least three hearts worth of Loyalty with that monster (Loyalty can be found on the monster's status menu; the max number of hearts is five). Loyalty is raised by simply having the monster accompany one's party and earn experience from fights, although the monster does not have to actually be an active fighter to raise its Loyalty.
Characters can also make use of different actions outside of combat. By hitting the B button, each character has a special field skill that can help the party complete puzzles or cross impassable terrain. Certain puzzles or mazes will have to be solved using these techniques at the proper times.
Eldin, Torma and Rami can change their current professions at any time, once the player has reached a certain point in the game. Each profession grants an immediate increase and decrease to certain stats, and professions dictate which statistics are increased when a character levels. Additionally, each job is given a rank, which is increased by gaining experience after a battle; certain jobs require a character to have already mastered another one to advance to it. For example, the ""Knight"" class gives a character increased strength, but lower intelligence, and the character must have obtained a master rank in ""Swordsman"" as a prerequisite to advance. Other jobs include Chemist, Bishop, Rogue, and Brawler. Also, the job of the character dictates which special moves and spells it learns during a battle. It's a good idea to switch jobs between the three to ensure a large variety of moves for each character, such as healing and attack spells for everyone. A typical setup would be to make both Eldin and Torma assume fighting-style jobs while Rami assumes magical-oriented ones, though this reduces diversity in skill among the three.
Similar to previous games in the series, The Ruins of Lore features a massive, optional dungeon called the Ancient Cave. Gameplay in the Ancient Cave differs from the regular gameplay in numerous respects. Only Eldin may enter it, along with his monster companion if he has one. He may also bring only 10 types of items along with him into the cave, not including anything he and his monster may have equipped. The menu is unable to be accessed in between fights in the dungeon, so keeping one's character healed during fights is vital. There are no monsters roaming around the maps, and the maps are randomly generated each time the player enters the cave. Monsters, as well as traps, are hiding in many of the bags and chests strewn about the dungeon, waiting for adventurers to stumble upon them. Each floor culminates in a boss fight at the end of the level. Victory allows the player to progress to the next floor of the dungeon. Lastly, the only way to leave the dungeon, short of dying and losing all of one's items, is to find and use an item that can only be found in the Ancient Cave, called Providence. Unlike Lufia II's Ancient Cave, this game's version has only 60 floors. The reward at the end is the Egg Ring, an accessory famous from Lufia II which greatly enhances the parameters of a character when worn. Incidentally, it is possible to get more Egg Rings after one's first completion so that all four heroes wear one.

Lunar Legend,,2002,Japan Art Media,Media RingsJPUbisoftNA,"NA, JP",NaN,"Lunar Legend plays very much like a traditional RPG, with 2D character sprites and environments. Unlike Lunar: The Silver Star, the battles do not consist of characters moving across the battlefield to attack enemies, instead having them retreat back to their original positions after attacking. The battles themselves are random, occurring every few steps within a dungeon or in scripted circumstances. By gaining experience after each fight, characters can level up, gaining new abilities and becoming stronger in the process. A new feature includes the use of special attacks akin to limit breaks via an ""Arts gauge"" underneath the character's HP and MP. It fills up as the character attacks enemies (whether or not the hit is successful) and once it's full, the character can unleash a powerful ability that generally does more damage than weapons or spells, or has a special effect such as rendering the party invincible for a short period of time. Ramus, Ghaleon and Laike, however, cannot unleash these special attacks.
Some of these special attacks can be changed by equipping certain items. For example, if Nash or Mia equip the Light Emblem accessory, it changes their special attacks to ""Charge"", which allows them to store magic power for one round. The next time they cast an attack spell, the damage is increased more than normal.
The player travels through the world of Lunar via the world map, visiting various towns, cities, and dungeons. Unlike The Silver Star, there are no random battles on the world map and each location is accessed by simply selecting it.

Magi Nation,,2002,Interactive Imagination,Epoch,JP,"Magi Nation follows Tony Jones, a timid human teenage boy, who has just recently moved into a new town. Upon meeting the local kids, they coerce him into entering a cave that they themselves are too frightened to enter. Tony explores the cave, and upon picking up a crystal, the cave collapses, and when he awakes from unconsciousness, he finds himself in a new, strange world. In a forest area, he summons a dream creature from the crystal and meets a man named Eidon. He is escorted to the city of Vash Naroom, located in a network of tree canopies and constructed of wood. His basic questions of the nature of this world are explained. Soon after his arrival, a menacing dungeon erupts from the ground in a nearby forest (called Shadow Geysers). In the following events, Tony is mistaken for a prophesied hero named ""Magus Kyros"" and, with no other option, he ventures across this new world, searching for the means by which he can return home.
Once the threatening Show Geyser appears in the Glade, an area east of Vash Naroom, Tony follows Eidon and Orwin, the elder of Vash Naroom, to inspect the dark structure. Orwin is fatally wounded by the dark powers of the Geyser, and is almost captured by the two bumbling Dark Magi, Zet and Korg. After consulting the somewhat questionable Seer, Tony discovers that the only way to save Orwin, Tony's only hope for returning home, is to find the rare Cloud Frond.
Tony travels to an area west of the Naroom Forest known as the Weave, and finds the home of Gia, the wise old woman whom Eidon trains under. She gives Tony the Core Glyph, and is surprised when he is able to hold the artefact without experiencing severe pain. This event leads her to believe that Tony may be the legendary Magus Kyros, who was prophesied to return to Magi Nation in a time of great peril. Tony then sets out to investigate the Naroom Shadow Geyser, which is full of Core Dream Creatures. Tony engages in a duel with Togoth, a Dark Magi who was supposed to protect what he calls the Core Gate, and afterwards escapes the crumbling Geyser with a Core Stone, one of four stones used to activate the Core Glyph and reach the Core. When the Geyser disappears, Tony notices a mysterious hooded figure that quickly disappears into a cave, who we later discover to be Morag, the leader of Agram's Dark Magi.
Tony then decides to travel to the Underneath in order to find the last three Core Stones which, according to Gia, should help him to access the Core and return to his home in Tavel Gorge. While in the Naroom Forest, he saves a young man named Wence from an attacking Agovo, who later ends up saving Tony's life. Tony arrives at the Underneath Town and meets several characters, including Gogor, the self-centered ""hero"" of the town, Motash, the village elder, and Ulk, the sister of Gruk and a good friend of Wence. Outside of town lies Gruk's mushfarm, where Tony ventures to help her resolve the strange noises coming from her basement. Tony arrives and is unable to save her from being kidnapped by Zet and Korg, who later make ridiculous demands to the Underneath townspeople in exchange for Gruk. Tony and Gogor travel to the abandoned fort, where they help free Gruk from her imprisonment.
Not soon after, a Shadow Geyser rises from Gruk's mushfarm, severely hurting her in the process. Motash realizes that Tony is the great Magus Kyros, and implores him to destroy the Geyser and then leave the Underneath. Tony once again picks his way through this Geyser, and after a battle with the Dark Magi Ogar, he receives another Core Stone and destroys the dark tower. However, he arrives back to town to see that the entire place has been destroyed by Morag and his Dark Magi. Morag turns Motash into a snake, and easily defeats Tony when he is approached. Tony is saved at the last moment by Wence, who shoots an arrow at Morag and scares him away.
After waking up from his faint in Wence's house, Tony returns to Gia's hut and tells her the terrible news about the Underneath. Suddenly, Morag, Korg, and Zet arrive and kidnap Tony, who is taken to the fiery Cald region. Morag uses another Core Stone to create a third Shadow Geyser, one surrounded by a lake of lava. He retreats before throwing Tony in the lava when a group of Caldlings arrive on the scene. Ashgar, the village elder, and the others accuse Tony of creating the Shadow Geyser. They are interrupted when panicked citizens announce that the town is under attack by Dark Magi. Tony quickly steps in and, with the help of the bridge builder Valkan, defeats the Shadow Magi. The townspeople apologize for accusing Tony, and ask that he quickly dispose of the Geyser.
Tony seeks the help of Valkan, who agrees to help build a bridge across the lava so Tony can reach the Geyser. As soon as the bridge is completed, however, it collapses into the lava. The embarrassed Valkan begs that Tony not tell anyone about the incident, in order to preserve his reputation, and tells Tony that he can jump over the lava with Agadon's Boots, which are kept locked up in a Vault in Orothe. After stealing the key to the vault from Ashgar's house, Tony travels aboard a ferry to the island of Orothe. Deep in the caves beneath the island he meets Blu, a lonely pirate who guards the vault. Tony unlocks the vault and retrieves the Boots, and also receives a horn from Blu in thanks for relieving him of his post as the vault guard. Blu tells Tony that if he is ever in danger, he can use to horn to call for help.
Tony then returns to the Cald Shadow Geyser and, using the boots, jumps over the lava and enters the tower. Tony defeats the Shadow Magi Korremar and receives the third Core Stone. In celebration of the destruction of the Shadow Geyser, the Caldlings hold a party for Tony. During a play about the heroism of Tony Jones, Morag appears and kidnaps Tony. Depending on how the player responds to the scenario, Morag may or may not kill two girls that Tony knows. Either way, Tony is taken to Shadowhold.
In the Shadowhold, Tony is placed in a cell as a prisoner. With assistance from an unknown aid, Tony is able to escape his cell in the Shadowhold, but finds himself cornered by Shadow Magi at the edge of the Shadowhold, next to the sea. Unable to swim, but desperate, Tony blows the horn Blu had given to him earlier and dives off of the edge of the fortress. Blu conveniently arrives and gives Tony a belt that allows him to swim and breath underwater, before leading him to Orothe, which is actually an undersea city resting on giant turtles.
Tony learns that a Shadow Geyser has appeared in Orothe, and all attempts to enter it have failed due to a barrier. Fearing for their safety, the denizens of the city have nearly all moved to calmer waters. Tony searches nearby ruins and learns a new spell that allows him to disable the barrier and enter the Shadow Geyser as the remaining Orotheans leave the area. Tony enters the Shadow Geyser and confronts Warrada, the Shadow Magi guardian of the geyser. Warrada offers to give Tony the Core Stone if he would simply stay out of their way. Regardless of Tony's choice, Tony obtains the Core Stone and returns to Gia, who has fled to Vash Naroom after her home was destroyed.
Gia explains that Tony is not the Great Magus Kyros, and that his mere presence in the realm has allowed an ancient enemy of the Magi, Agram, to return. Tony agrees to leave after sorrowful urging from Gia, and heads to the Core Gate near the remains of Gia's old home. After activating the Core Glyph, Tony appears to return home, but is actually ambushed by Korg and Zet. Tony engages and defeats both Korg and Zet, before winged beings descend and tell Tony that a Shadow Geyser has appeared in Arderial, their home territory that sits atop the clouds, and that Shadow Magi are terrorizing everyone. Wondering how another geyser appeared, Tony agrees to meet with the Arderial queen, Jaela.
Tony meets with Jaela, but the conversation is interrupted by the appearance of Morag, who has a small scuffle with the queen before Agram appears himself and causes Jaela to vanish. Agram attempts to explain himself to Tony, who angrily vows that he will stop Agram no matter what. Intrigued, Agram tells Tony that if he can defeated Morag in the Arderial Shadow Geyser, Agram will be waiting in the Core for Tony. Tony enters the Shadow Geyser and defeats Morag, gaining a fifth Core Stone.
Tony heads back to the Core, seeing hundreds of petrified people, including those he has met along his journey, along the way. Tony confronts Agram and, after an intense battle, defeats him. After Agram's defeat, the petrified people are returned to normal, and Jaela tells Tony that he may step into the light in Agram's throne room to return home. Tony returns home and is accepted by the group that sent him into the cave. Back in Magi Nation, a funeral is held for Orwin in Vash Naroom (or a party, if Orwin is saved during the game). It is optional to refuse to step into the light by trying to leave the throne room, in which case Tony can attend the funeral (or party).
","Magi Nation involves taming dream creatures and using them to fight. Whenever a creature is defeated, the player may receive that creature's animite, a magical stone containing its essence. These can later be used to forge rings which allow the player to summon during the battle. Each Magi may summon up to four dream creatures at a time, and with up to ten rings equipped, ten dream creatures total at their disposal. Magi are able to fight on their own, casting spells or regenerating energy.

Magical Vacation,,2001,Brownie Brown,Nintendo,JP,NaN,"The game is a standard RPG adventure game, where the player interacts with the overworld to progress the story while battling against enemies in a turn-based battle system. There are 16 different elements in the game, each of which is stronger than another specific element, and weaker against another. Exceptions to this rule are: the love element (not stronger or weaker than any of the other elements), the dark element (stronger than all other elements except for love and light), and the light element (no weakness).
The player can increase the power of attacks by borrowing power from elemental spirits in a process called Seirei Combo (ç²¾éã³ã³ã, spirit combo). To use a spirit combo, the player must summon an elemental spirit, and use magic of the same element in the following turns to release vast amounts of damage. Attack power is doubled per spirit present, meaning 2 spirits would create 4 times as much damage, and 3 spirits would create 8 times as much. The maximum combo (7 spirits) yields 128 times as much damage. The power of basic magic can surpass that of advanced magic if the player uses this combo. However, certain special rules apply to its use. For instance, the enemy can summon spirits of a stronger element to eliminate the combo's effectiveness (having one fire elemental spirit will eliminate the effect of one wind elemental spirit), and spirits can be extracted from the field using certain spells. The combo also applies for bombs which contain the magic power of an element. The maximum number of spirits that can be summoned is 7 (regardless of how many spirits were present at the start of the battle), and spirits must be re-summoned per combo use.
This system allows the player to interact with the Game Boy Advance's multiplayer link. The first option, Let's Amigo (ã¬ããã¢ãã¼ã´), allows players to exchange main characters to acquire new spells. For instance, exchanging between a wind elemental main character and a sound elemental one will allow the wind elemental character to learn a sound elemental spell, and vice versa. Magic learned in this way can be strengthened with experience like all other spells from the beginning of the game. Each player can also receive ""special"" spell data, which can be equipped to allied characters. However, equipped spells will not strengthen with experience. Exchanging a certain number of times will give the main character a new spell or change their element. Love magic is acquired if the player exchanges with 5 players of the same element. Exchanging 100 times will change the main character's element to the dark element and change their appearance to the dark costume. Learning all of the spells in the game and fulfilling the two prior requirements will give the main character light magic, change their element to the light element, and change them into the light costume.
The second option, Let's Onsen (ã¬ãããããã, let's go to the hot springs) becomes available if the player has gone to the hot spring in the Plain of Light at least once during the game. Using the other player's hot spring will increase the main character's powers (different types of hot springs improve different status points; using the same hot spring repeatedly decreases the probability of powering up). After a certain number of uses, the player may be offered a choice to upgrade their hot spring. The level of upgrade is dependent on the player's rank of gameplay.
The third option, Let's Taisen (ã¬ãããããã, let's battle), is the multiplayer battle mode. A multiplayer battle is conducted in the same way as regular battles in the story mode, but winning a certain number of battles or maintaining a certain winning percentage awards the main character a special title that boosts their abilities. 3 elemental spirits (chosen randomly) also appear at the beginning of every multiplayer turn.
Nintendo organized two events in 2002 to gather Magical Vacation players together to make the Amigo system more accessible. The first event was held on January 26 in Osaka, and the second event was held the following day on January 27 in Tokyo. These events allowed players who only had access to one game cartridge to quickly gain power-ups for their characters.

Major League Baseball 2K7,,2007,Skyworks Technologies,2K Sports,,NaN,"The new iteration features a stunningly lifelike batter/pitcher interface on seventh generation console systems, as well as more detailed models and AI tweaks. Last year's ""Inside Edge"" also returns, with a tweak in that playing to a player's strengths causes a boost in ability.
Other new features, as published by 2K Sports, include:
Other additions include a ramped up player and manager ejection system, including a minigame in which the player controlling the manager will tap a button to argue with the umpire; in multiplayer, the opponent will take control of the umpire and try to precision tap a button to eject the opponent's manager. A managerial ejection will cause the player's team to be controlled by the CPU.[6] Umpires also have their own personalities and AI, meaning each umpire will have a unique style of calling a game.[4] An important feature is the use of the joystick's force feedback during same-machine multiplayer - as the invisible icon reaches the edges of the strike zone, the rumble will increase. (PlayStation 3 owners are not able to enjoy this feature due to the lack of such a feature in the gamepad.) Other minor touches include ball boys retrieving baseballs, fans catching foul balls, and dynamic bullpen activity. The PS2 features are tuned fielding, improved baseruning, 2K sports online play, and Inside Edge.

Manic Miner,,2002,Jester Interactive,Jester Interactive,PAL,NaN,"At the time, its stand-out features included in-game music and sound effects, high replay value, and colourful graphics, which were well designed for the graphical limitations of the ZX Spectrum. The Spectrum's video display allowed the background and foreground colours to be exchanged automatically without software attention and the ""animated"" load screen appears to swap the words Manic and Miner through manipulation of this feature.
On the Spectrum this was the first game with in-game music, the playing of which required constant CPU attention and was thought impossible. It was achieved by constantly alternating CPU time between the music and the game.  This results in the music's stuttery rhythm. The in-game music is In the Hall of the Mountain King from Edvard Grieg's music to Henrik Ibsen's play Peer Gynt. The music that plays during the title screen is an arrangement of The Blue Danube.
In each of the twenty caverns, each one screen in size, are several flashing objects, which the player must collect before Willy's oxygen supply runs out. Once the player has collected the objects in one cavern, they must then go to the now-flashing portal, which will take them to the next cavern. The player must avoid enemies, listed in the cassette inlay as ""...Poisonous Pansies, Spiders, Slime, and worst of all, Manic Mining Robots..."", which move along predefined paths at constant speeds. Willy can also be killed by falling too far, so players must time the precision of jumps and other movements to prevent such falls or collisions with the enemies.
Extra lives are gained every 10,000 points, and the game ends when the player either has no lives left, or completes all twenty caverns and escapes to the open air.[4] Above the final portal is a garden. To the right is a house with a white picket fence and red car parked in front. To the left is a slope leading to backyard with a pond and tree; a white animal, resembling a cat or mouse, watches the sun set behind the pond. Upon gaining his freedom, Miner Willy simply walks off the right of the screen, never looking back.
There are some differences between the Bug-Byte and Software Projects versions. The scroll-text during the attract mode is different, to reflect the new copyright, and there are also several other cosmetic changes, although gameplay remains the same:

Mar Heaven: Knockin' on Heaven's Door,,2005,Alpha Unit,Konami,JP,"Ginta Toramizu is a 14-year-old junior high student from Tokyo who is portrayed as a typical video game geek and underachieving student who is a fan of fairy tales. One day and without warning, he finds himself summoned to the mysterious world of MÃR-Heaven which he has only seen before in his dreams and in his mother's books. In this fairy tale world, Ginta's physical weakness is replaced with superior physical strength, incredible stamina and endurance, and being able to see without his glasses.
Upon meeting a mysterious 16-year-old witch named Dorothy, Ginta is introduced to the powerful magical accessories and weapons called ""ÃRM"" (pronounced air-um). Dorothy plans to steal the mysterious ÃRM Babbo from a trap-guarded cave, and brings Ginta along to assist her, intrigued by his unusual strength and abilities. Babbo is revealed to be an extremely special and unique ÃRM, as he possesses a will of his own and the ability to speak. Displeased with the fact that Babbo is so cumbersome, Dorothy gives Babbo to Ginta instead taking the guardian arm that guarded the chest, departing with a warning that others will try to steal Babbo from him.
He continues on a journey of discovery, reveling in this new world. When he encounters the farmer Jack and his mother, who are troubled by two werewolf brothers, he finds that he misses the real world. Ginta resolves to find a way to reach home while enjoying as much of MÃR as he can along the way with Jack journeying with him.
However, it is not long before Ginta learns that the world of MÃR-Heaven is not as peaceful as it seems when he is attacked by thieves wishing to steal Babbo. Upon meeting Alviss (who summoned him to MÃR-Heaven using a ÃRM known as the Gate Keeper Clown), he learns of the sinister ""Chess Pieces"" and how they had tried to take over MÃR-Heaven six years earlier. Alviss reveals that he summoned Ginta in order to gain assistance from an ""other-worlder"" in the upcoming war, as was done previously, and that Babbo originally belonged to one of the knights of the Chess Pieces.
Gaining both allies and enemies, the series follows Ginta as he opposes the Chess Pieces led by Chess Piece King Orb, Queen Diana and her servant Phantom.
The story started 6 years after the second War Games, about Kai, the adoptive son of an ÃRM smith from Harnau City in MÃR Heaven, who idolizes Ginta and Babbo for defeating Phantom at the end of the 2nd War Games. He always wants a good ÃRM for himself, which is often ridiculed by others since Kai possesses no potential whatsoever of magic power, much to his personal dislike, since at the time throughout MÃR-Heaven ÃRMs are already in wide use (especially a new type called fake ÃRMs, activated without the need of magic power), and Kai himself inherited a magic stone from his dead parents, a memento highly suggested his family's relation to the sorcerer kingdom Kaldea. When Kai was delivering ÃRMs to another city, he walked past a mountain and suddenly got attacked by a remnant of the Chess Pieces. While searching for cover from the Chess Pieces's wind Nature ÃRM, Kai jumped into a pond and woke up the most unthinkable underwater resident - Babbo. Using the ÃRM Kai defeated the Chess Piece, one amazing yet inexplicable feat: how was he, a normal boy, be able to fight with the ÃRM up til then can only be wielded only the warriors of legend, Ginta and Phantom.
Leaving the question hanging, the two returned to Kai's city, only to find themselves in an even tighter situation: among those who came to admire Babbo, there are Kai's fake ÃRM user friends, and they were all out to take Babbo - to bring it to a sinister mysterious figure who was watching them the whole time. When the emergency arose, Kai had no choice but to resort to his last option - put the magic stone he owned into Babbo, and forth reborn to the world of MÃR-Heaven the most powerful Guardian recognized, Gargoyle. Gargoyle easily defeated the guardians and returned their owners' consciousness, but then it was Kai's turn to face trouble with his ÃRM: he lost contact with Babbo inside Gargoyle, and the monster would have ravaged the whole town if not for the timely restraint from Alviss with his familiar 13 Totem Poles attack, allowing Kai enough time to regain synchronization with Babbo, returning him to normal.
Saving everyone no time to ponder on what had happened, the Cross Guard's young warrior's unexpected arrival brought an even more unexpected truth: those fake ÃRM all used so at their own ease didn't, indeed, require a proper amount of magic power from the users, but it sucked from them a worse fuel - their life energy, and through that, their minds could be controlled like a puppet dancing to death. It has not yet been revealed to why people used the fake ÃRMs or who made the fake ÃRM, however, as the one controlling everyone took a sudden desperate move to seal the town except Alviss, Kai, Babbo and Kai's female friend Elise, introducing himself. Although he was easily defeated by Kai and Alviss, the town couldn't be returned, and for that they had to consult Caldia -birthplace of all ÃRMs and magic users.
In Caldia, they were welcomed by Dorothy and a new male character named Inga into the Grand Elder's palace. All answers for their questions were ready, coming down to a legend descending the magic kingdom for 300 years: the fake ÃRMs were not actually the work of many sorcerers, but rather only one's - the dark magician with infamy for his experiments of human mind manipulation, went by the name of Unwetter. Babbo - the Elder of Caldia in his time - confronted the man and succeeded in consigning him and his malicious creations into oblivion, just before Babbo himself died, transferring his soul into the ÃRM and erasing every memory related to that accident. It's unknown for the Grand Elder himself, however, as to why the supposedly sealed fake ÃRMs were once again spread throughout MÃR-Heaven now, how the supposedly dead Unwetter could be revived, and what purpose would be served with the claiming of Babbo. Either way, until these riddles could be solved, Babbo would be taken into custody, which of course met with Kai's disagreement.
Relented, the wizard postponed the deal with Babbo... only if Kai could prove himself worthy of wielding it, inside Dorothy's training Dimension ÃRM with Inga's witness. They were not disappointed, however, as when facing with the danger of death, Kai suddenly unleashed all his dormant magic power - which was so powerful that it did not only confirm his relation to the magic kingdom, but also suggested a direct blood connection to Babbo. No sooner had they discovered that than the fake ÃRM users presented themselves before Caldia, to continue the accomplishment of their objective: take Babbo back to their master Unwetter.
Kai and crew are able to fight them back with the assistance of Inga. Inga is a descendant of Unwetter and by following Caldia's law he must seek Unwetter out and kill him. Kai then finds out that he truly is a descendant of Babbo. Kai, Inga, and Elise all volunteer to go and find Babbo's magic stones which would restore his memories of the Grand Elder who fought fake Arms and Unwetter 300 years prior to the story. The three are sent to Luberia to start their quest where they are to be helped by Nanashi (Dorothy says she'll help). Kai beats Atmos and saves MÃR-Heaven.

Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga|Mario & Luigi RPGJP,"Yes (COOP, SPM)",2003,AlphaDream,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The gameplay of Mario & Luigi differs from most other role-playing games due to its focus on controlling Mario and Luigi simultaneously. During overworld sections, the directional pad controls Mario's movement with Luigi following closely, while Mario and Luigi's other actions are controlled individually with the A (Mario) and B (Luigi) buttons respectively.[5] The game begins with them being able to jump independently, though they would soon gain access to hammers and a variety of other techniques as the game progresses. For example, Luigi's hammer can be used to squash Mario into a smaller size, allowing the latter to access small gaps, while placing Mario on Luigi's shoulders allows them to act like a propeller and hover across large gaps.[6] Various enemies roam the overworld, and coming into contact with these enemies initiates a battle. Landing a hit on the enemy while on the overworld allows the player to deal pre-emptive damage, while the opposite is also possible.
Battles in Superstar Saga are turn-based. Mario and Luigi can attack normally either by jumping, which can deal multiple hits but when used against enemies covered in flames or with spikes, Mario or Luigi will get hurt, instead of the enemy. Another attack option is the hammer, which is powerful, but ineffective against flying enemies. Similar to previous Mario role-playing titles, such as Super Mario RPG and the Paper Mario series, players can time button presses to make their attacks more effective, such as earning an extra jump attack or increasing the hammer's power.[7] Introduced in this series is the way in which Mario and Luigi can defend themselves during an enemy's attack. When an enemy attacks, the brothers would be able to either jump or use their hammer which, when successfully timed, allows them to dodge their attacks and even deal counter damage (for example: if they jump on top of a charging Goomba). Throughout the game, players can unlock Bros. Attacks, which use Bros. Points (BP) which requires players to cooperate between Mario and Luigi's actions to perform powerful combination attacks.[4][8] Players can also use items such as mushrooms for healing, peppers for boosting stats and 1UP mushrooms for reviving fallen Bros. Defeating enemies earns experience points which help the Bros. level up and increase their stats, with players given the option to further increase the stats of one attribute every time they level up. Players can further improve their stats by equipping new gear to the Bros. or making them wear badges that give them special attributes.
Like other Mario titles for the Game Boy Advance, Superstar Saga features the enhanced remake of the Mario Bros. arcade game, which was used in the four Super Mario Advance titles.[9][10] The game also supports rumble functionality when used with the GameCube's Game Boy Player accessory.[5]

Mario Kart: Super Circuit|Mario Kart AdvanceJP,Yes (SPM),2001,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Super Circuit is a kart racing video game in which the player races in a kart against other teams in different courses. The game screen indicates the current standings in a race, the number of laps needed to finish and incoming weapons. Like in the previous installments, players can pick up item boxes to receive a randomly selected item and use it to impede the opposition and gain the advantage. Some items, such as shells and banana peels, allow the player to hit others to slow them down, while other items, such as the star power-up, render them temporarily invincible to attacks. This is the second Mario Kart game to include coins, which increases the engine power of the karts.
There are five game modes in Super Circuit: Mario GP, Time Trial, Quick Run, VS., and Battle. Most of the modes can be played by themselves in single-player races, while some can be played in multiplayer.
Super Circuit features the same cast of playable drivers as in the previous installment, each placed in one of three weight classes. Peach, Yoshi, and Toad are light, Mario and Luigi are medium, and Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Wario are heavy. In addition to the playable drivers, other characters have supporting roles in this game as well. Lakitu reprises his role as the referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with a traffic light hanging on his fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in Super Circuit include Shy Guys, Piranha Plants, Boos and more.

Depending on the character chosen, the player will start at a different area on the board.[2] The player starts with four Mushrooms.[2] Additional Mushrooms are earned by winning minigames that are played every three turns.[4] The game is over when there are no Mushrooms left. The multiplayer Party Mode that was present in all of the previous Mario Party games is no longer available, and it has been replaced by a new mode called ""Shroom City"". The aim of the game is to collect all the minigames and ""Gaddgets"" that were scattered around Shroom City by Bowser, by completing quests assigned to the player by the various inhabitants of Shroom City.
Gaddgets, invented by Professor E. Gadd, are interactive items such as a Morse code generator and a love meter.[4] The game includes over 120 minigames, including Gaddgets. Approximately 12 of the minigames can be played in multiplayer mode, with the use of a Game Link Cable. Certain Gaddgets can also be played in multiplayer mode if players control different buttons on a single Game Boy Advance system.[4] The game also included a paper game board for multiple players that could be played in conjunction with the game cartridge, used by players to roll the dice and to play minigames.[4][5]

Mario Tennis: Power TourNA|Mario Power TennisPAL|Mario Tennis AdvanceJP,Yes,2005,Camelot Software Planning,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","The game starts as the main character wakes up in unfamiliar surroundings. Their partner explains that the protagonist has enrolled at the Royal Tennis Academy, and he/she is the character's doubles partner. Having passed out the previous day during the Welcome Workout, they decide to get some breakfast. When they arrive at the restaurant, it is deserted and they find out that masked challengers have challenged the top academy students, including Alex, who is implied to be the top-ranked player at the academy. After hearing that the masked players defeated the school champions, they set out to become the top ranked player, in order to enter the main tournament (The Island Open) and discover the masked players' true identities.
After defeating the Junior and Senior classes, the player advances to the Varsity Level.  Learning that only the two highest ranked doubles pairs are guaranteed entry in the tournament, the main character defeats the entire Varsity class.  The player, their partner, and two other players named Elroy (Excel in the Japanese version, who is also the varsity captain) and Tori enter the Island Open.
After the winning the Island Open, the players has not yet discovered the identities of the masked players. However, the morning following their win, the two main characters are approached by Alex and led to a secret airport near the academy. Here, they meet Mario, who is implied to have been one of the masked players, and are taken to Peach's Kingdom to participate in the Peach Tournament against the other characters in the game. Winning the tournament ends the doubles game.
Afterwards, the main character becomes the singles champion of the school and wins the Island Open on their own, again traveling to the Mushroom Kingdom to play in the Peach Tournament. Winning this Tournament effectively ends the Story Mode's main plot line, and the main character presumably goes home the hero of the academy.
","The gameplay of Power Tour is similar to Mario Power Tennisâ gameplay. Players play tennis with other characters, in both doubles and singles, and there are several mechanics such as topspin, slice, and ""Power Shots"" (Special Shots in the Japanese version). There are both Offensive Power Shots and Defensive Power Shots which are earned further in the game. Offensive Power Shots are very powerful attacks; they power-up the ball and when they make contact with another player, they cause an effect such as being knocked back a little bit, running around dazed, etc. Defensive Power Shots can negate the secondary effects of Offensive Power Shots and they can reach balls which normally would be out of reach. There are topspin and slice, and topspin has more power than slice, while slice exchanges a tiny bit of power for more curve in the character's shot. As well as this, there is also a variety of shots, such as lobs or smashes.
There are several characters in Power Tour. The two main characters to choose from are Clay (Max in the European version; Norty in the Japanese version), a male power player, and Ace (Tina in the European version; Tabby in the Japanese version), a female technical player. The player can change the name of the character they choose to play as, and also choose the character's dominant hand for playing tennis (right or left). The character the player did not choose will be their doubles partner and his/her name cannot be changed.
The game features a variety of characters from the Mario Tennis game for Game Boy Color, who return as coaches. These includes Alex, the male protagonist from the first game. His varsity teammates are featured as coaches at the various levels of play.

Nick Fury sends out a distress call to all available superheroes for assistance. Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor and Wolverine respond to the call. Along with the other heroes, they save the Helicarrier from the forces led by Scorpion, Bullseye, Winter Soldier, Radioactive Man, and Fin Fang Foom. In the wake of the attack, Nick Fury is given permission to start a task force to confront the Masters of Evil and Iron Man allows them to use Stark Tower as their headquarters.[15]
Fury asks the heroes to investigate an odd message received from Dum Dum Dugan on the Omega Base, a S.H.I.E.L.D. mobile research facility. The team defeats supervillains MODOK, Crimson Dynamo, and Mysterio as well as A.I.M. Agents and failed Super Soldier experiments to prevent the Omega Base from crashing in to a dam and launching several gamma bombs.
With their mission successful, the heroes travel to Atlantis, where the inhabitants are being mind-controlled by Attuma, who has usurped Namor from his throne.[16] With the help of nano-technology that enables them to breathe and move freely underwater, the heroes fight the mind-controlled Atlanteans, destroy the towers which are guarded by Warlord Krang and Byrrah, rescue Namor, and defeat Attuma and Tiger Shark. After defeating Attuma, the heroes encounter Mandarin, who unleashes the Kraken, which the team defeats by toppling pillars on it.
They then travel to the Valley of Spirits to confront Mandarin in his palace. After his defeat, he reveals that he attempted to take command of the Masters of Evil and, upon failing, left the group. He suggests that the Mandarin they saw in the catacombs was actually Loki, god of mischief.[17]
Upon returning to base, the team learns that Nightcrawler and Jean Grey have been kidnapped. Due to the involvement of mystical forces, Fury has the team relocated to the Sanctum Sanctorum. Professor X tracks Nightcrawler to Castle Doom, but upon trying to transport the heroes there they are sent to Murderworld by a spell from Baron Mordo. After defeating a mind-controlled Jean Grey, Rhino, and Shocker, the heroes battle a large mech, piloted by Arcade.
Victorious, the heroes learn that Doctor Doom has used Nightcrawler to access Mephisto's Realm, and the team is sent in pursuit.[18] Upon arriving, minions of Mephisto kidnap Jean Grey and Nightcrawler. Mephisto's son Blackheart puts them in separate cages above the Infinity Vortex, stating one must be saved and the other sacrificed before the team can defeat Mephisto. During their battle with Mephisto the sacrificed hero returns, resurrected by Mephisto, but now under his control. As a final effort, the resurrected hero sacrifices their life to defeat Mephisto and allow the team to escape.
Meanwhile, in Asgard, a massive army of Super Soldiers attacks and imprisons the Asgardian gods.[19] The heroes travel to Valhalla to liberate it from its invading force and free Heimdall (who is guarded by Rhino and Shocker), Tyr (who is guarded by Scorpion and Lizard), and Balder (who is guarded by Enchantress and Executioner). Then they fight the Wrecking Crew and undead soldiers unleashed by Hela to open Bifrost Bridge in order for reinforcements to arrive. Looking for Odin in Niffleheim following a fight with Kurse and Ulik, they find his shattered Twilight Sword and learn from Ymir that Doctor Doom and Loki have taken Odin to Raven's Spire. After Loki is seemingly defeated at Raven's Spire, the team frees the Destroyer Armor to use against Doctor Doom. Loki, disguised as Fury, reveals himself and his plot to have the heroes free the armor for nefarious purposes. As heroes defeat Loki and the armor, Doctor Doom appears and reveals that he has stolen Odin's power. He uses it to attempt to eliminate the heroes, but Uatu the Watcher saves them and transports them to the Inhumans' base on the moon.
Uatu reveals the only way to defeat Doom is to acquire a piece of the M'Kraan Crystal and steal the Muonic Inducer from Galactus (who is currently attacking the Skrull homeworld).[20]
The team is sent to the Shi'ar Empire where they fight Deathbird and the Imperial Guard in order to restore Lilandra Neramani to the throne and gain a portion of the M'Kraan Crystal. After retrieving the crystal, the heroes travel to the Skrull homeworld. With the help of the Silver Surfer, the heroes disable Galactus and steal the Muonic Inducer.
Meanwhile, Doctor Doom conquers Earth, corrupting and creating clones of many of the heroes. In a final effort, the team travels to Latveria to confront Doom. The heroes use the M'Kraan Crystal and Muonic Inducer to weaken Doom. As the heroes weaken Doom, he is blasted by a bolt of lightning sent by a rejuvenated Odin, leaving nothing but his mask behind.
As the heroes meet on the repaired Helicarrier, Fury asks Thor to thank Odin for undoing the damages to which Thor states that Odin is currently busy punishing Doctor Doom and Loki. Fury informs the heroes that the team must disband and asks if S.H.I.E.L.D. can count on them when another threat happens. Captain America assures Nick that the world can count on them.[21]
Meanwhile, Galactus vows revenge on the heroes who stole from him and plans to destroy Earth.
Marvel: Ultimate Alliance features over 140 characters,[22] and in addition the heroes battle evil versions of both themselves and other heroes throughout the game.

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions are virtually identical, with no major differences. Both platforms include Colossus, Moon Knight, and five additional comic book missions. Activision released eight additional downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 26, 2007 in a set of packs: a Hero Pack, consisting of Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Hawkeye, and the Hulk, and a Villain Pack, which includes Magneto, Sabretooth, Venom, and a playable Doctor Doom. Both packs are also available in a bundle pack for 800 MSP, which adds 12 new achievements to the game.[5] The Gold Edition was released for the Xbox 360 in May 2007 which includes the standard game bundled with all downloadable content.[6] The Platinum Hits version was released for the Xbox 360 in September 2007. The set includes all the Gold Edition of the game and a bonus DVD.[7] As of December 2009, the DLC was removed from the Xbox LIVE Marketplace by Activision, meaning the only way to play as the downloadable characters was to purchase the Gold Edition or the Platinum Hits version. The Xbox 360 Games on Demand version now bundles the full game with all previously downloadable content.[8]
The Wii version has a few features unique to itself including specific motion-sensitive controls for normal moves, motion-sensitive controlled special attacks (the attacks are unique for each character, but not the motions), and access to any special move at any time. This version contains no online play but has a local multiplayer mode in which up to four players may play at once. It also features the characters Colossus and Moon Knight, as well as five additional comic book missions.
The PC version is customizable, and many characters (including those exclusive to all other versions) and their modifications can be obtained from community sites for play within the game.[9] The PC version's graphics vary depending on the customization of a user's settings. The PC version also features ""intuitive mouse controls"" and works with a gamepad.[10] A number of custom characters (including Jean Grey, Psylocke, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Vision, Dazzler, and Punisher) are available.[9]
The re-release version of the game which came to Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows via Steam is based on Xbox 360âs Gold Edition. However, re-release was initially released with the contents which were exclusive to seventh generation consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii), but without the DLC featured originally on Xbox 360. On August 30, 2016 an update was released on these three systems which contained the eight downloadable characters previously featured on the Xbox 360.
The PSP version features simplified graphics, different characters, and extra features including the four exclusive playable Marvel characters Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Hawkeye, and Ronin.[11] Other things unique to this version are 6 exclusive comic book missions including one which contains Swordsman, an exclusive prequel mission, and three exclusive single-player gameplay modes.[12] Added features include online play, microphone support (voice chat), and online-recordable player statistics.[12] The PlayStation 2 version of the game has the same features as the next-gen versions of the game, albeit without Colossus, Moon Knight and the five bonus simulator missions. In August 2007, a Greatest Hits version was released which included a bonus DVD containing a making-of featurette. The Xbox version of the game has no changes from the standard PlayStation 2 edition. However, it is possible to play as Colossus and Moon Knight via a glitch which can be accessed through a series of steps.[13]
The Game Boy Advance version of Ultimate Alliance features significant differences from the other console versions. Most notably, the basic gameplay takes the form of a side-scrolling fighting game with minor RPG elements, such as the ability to alter the player characters' stats. The graphics are simplified for this system and the selection of characters has also been reduced. Some additional gameplay modes were added to this version of the game including a S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator, Time Challenges, Scavenger Hunts, and a Survival mode.[14] Teams for this port consist of three characters, a striker, and a non-playable fourth character who can be summoned to perform a powerful attack directed toward on-screen enemies.[14]

Mary-Kate and Ashley: Sweet 16 - Licensed to Drive,,2002,Powerhead Games,Acclaim,"NA, PAL",NaN,"In Mary-Kate and Ashley: Sweet 16 - Licensed to Drive players can control one of four characters: Mary-Kate, Ashley, Tiffany, or Clair. Players can choose between two regions, beach and mountain. The three game modes are: Adventure, Bring It On, and Arcade.
In Adventure mode, players go around the selected region for three laps by default, but players may choose to extend the game up to ten laps. As players go around the region, they land in spaces where they can pick up friends, receive coins, or participate in challenges. After each lap, players compete in one of the 30 mini-games[3] to earn points. Players also compete in mini-games if they: land on the same space; or, pick up a friend which is already riding with another player. In the first case, the winner gets the space and the loser is pushed back one. In the second case, the friend rides with the winning player[4][5]
In Bring it On mode, there are no regions and players compete in mini-games. The first player to win three mini-games wins the game. Playtime can be extended by setting the required wins to five, seven, or nine.
In Arcade mode, a single mini-game can be selected. Winning this game mode yields no results.[6][7]
Mary-Kate and Ashley: Sweet 16 - Licensed to drive also came out on the Game Boy Advance. While the story is the same, the genre is changed to a driving game. The game is split into the same game modes as the main console releases but the only characters available for play are Mary-Kate and Ashley, there are only seven mini-games, and there is one map, which is that of a town. The main goal is to drive around to all the checkpoints before the timer runs out with optional destinations that reward the player with points. When the player finishes a level, they are rewarded with a letter grade.[8]

Masters of the Universe - He-man Power of Grayskull,,2002,Taniko,TDK Mediactive,,NaN,NaN
Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX,,2001,HotGen,Activision,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX uses a tweaked version of the game engine used in a similar video game, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The goal of the game is to successfully perform and combine different tricks on a BMX bike, with successful executions adding to the player's score. The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, and the number of times the tricks have been used (the more often a trick is used, the less it's worth). Successful tricks also add to the player's special meter, which, once full, allows for the execution of ""signature moves"" which are worth more than normal tricks. Grinds, lip tricks, and manuals (wheelies) are included in the game to help the player link tricks together into combos. Bails (falling off the bike due to poor landing) cause for no points to be awarded for the attempted trick or combo, and resets the special bar to empty.
The player can play as one of eight different professional BMX riders, including Mat Hoffman, Rick Thorne, Dennis McCoy (BMX rider) and Mike Escamilla. Tony Hawk is featured as a hidden character, as is a fictional elderly character named ""Granny"". Each rider has their own individual stats, bikes, and trick-sets.
Ten levels exist in the game (including two remade levels from Pro Skater), consisting of street, vert, and dirt track-oriented courses. Secret areas, point-bonuses, and many breakable objects are scattered amongst the levels.
Career Mode â In Career Mode, the player has five magazine covers (i.e. objectives) to obtain in six of the eight levels. The player has only two minutes in which to obtain a cover after which their run ends; however, individual objectives are marked off once completed. In each level, two of the covers are acquired by reaching set scores (with the second score being two to three times the amount required for the first), one is obtained by collecting the five letters to spell ""T-R-I-C-K"", one is a hidden cover which the player must find in the level, and one requirement varies from level to level, but always involves doing something to five objects (e.g., ""smash five lights""). The other two levels are competitions, where the goal is to receive a gold, silver, or bronze medal by ranking higher than the other riders. In these levels, the basis for ranking is not the player's score, but the mean number of points given on a scale of one to ten by three computer AI judges after three sets. Advancing in Career mode allows the player to unlock new levels, bikes, and secret riders.
Single Session â In this mode, the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, and available level, and rides for a two-minute session in an attempt to set a high score. While similar to the two-minute session in career mode, there are no specific goals for the player to attempt.
Free Ride â Free Ride is similar to the Single Session mode; the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, and an available level. Instead of a two-minute timer, however, there is no time limit, allowing the player to practice or simply explore, searching for gaps and secrets areas.
Multiplayer modes â The game features several split-screen multi-player modes including Trick Attack, Horse, and Graffiti.
Park Editor â This mode allows the player to create their own level by arranging various ramps, rails, and other pieces. Gaps can be created and named, and the player's starting positions can also be chosen by the player. Once a created park is finished, the level can be accessed in the game's ""Single Session"", ""Free Ride"", and multiplayer modes. Five pre-made parks, which were created using Park Editor, were included in the game as samples of the editor's potential.

Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2,,2002,HotGen,Activision,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Like its predecessor, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 uses the basic game structure carried over from Activision's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series of video games. The goal of the game is to successfully perform and combine different tricks on a BMX bike, with successful executions adding to the player's score. The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, and the number of times the tricks have been used (the more often a trick is used, the less it's worth).

Bails (falling off the bike due to poor landing) cause for no points to be awarded for the attempted trick or combo, and resets the special bar to empty.
Enhancements over the previous installment include improved graphics, new tricks (including flatland tricks and a ""trick tweaking system"", similar to the trick modifier featured in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX), a balance meter for grind and lip tricks, more riders, a longer career mode, a larger soundtrack, and larger, more interactive environments.
The player can choose from eleven different professional BMX riders, with each rider having their own unique stats, bikes, and trick sets. Eight levels are included in the game, set in and around various cities across the United States. The Xbox version features a total of twelve professional BMX riders and nine levels: rider Chad Kagy and the London level are exclusive to this release.
Road Trip â ""Road Trip"" is the equivalent to the previous game's ""Career Mode"". In this mode, the player has to complete different tasks (such as getting a high score or collecting items) in an attempt to earn points and advance to new levels. Each level has twelve goals to complete (as opposed to five in the first game), broken up into three categories based on difficulty. Only four goals are available at one time, which must be completed before unlocking the next set of challenges. Advancing in this mode allows the player to unlock new levels, bikes, riders, and songs from the game's soundtrack. Videos are also unlocked which includes over 90 minutes of footage from a real BMX tour featuring the pros, which promoted the game.
Session â  In this mode, the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, an available level, and rides for a one to five-minute session in an attempt to set a high score.
Free Ride â Free Ride is similar to the Session mode; the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, and an available level. Instead of a timed session, however, there is no time limit, allowing the player to practice or simply explore, searching for gaps and secrets areas.
Tiki Battle â After completing the Road Trip mode, a bonus game is unlocked, called the ""Tiki Battle"", which acts as a first person shooter. The player attempts to defeat a large animated statue located in the Hawaii level of the game, collecting ammunition and health bonuses while avoiding fireballs thrown at the player. When this challenge is completed, a special character is unlocked and the ""Tiki Battle"" becomes available in the main menu of the game.
Multiplayer modes â The game features several new and returning multi-player modes including Horse, Trick Attack, Graffiti, Tag, and Push.
Course Editor â This mode allows the player to create their own level by arranging various ramps, rails, and other pieces. Gaps can be created and named, and the player's starting positions can also be chosen by the player. Once a created park is finished, the level can be accessed in the game's ""Session"", ""Free Ride"", and multiplayer modes.

Max PayneNA|Max Payne AdvancePAL,No,2003,MÃ¶bius Entertainment,Rockstar Games,"NA, PAL","The story is told in medias res, and consists of three volumes: ""The American Dream"", ""A Cold Day in Hell"", and ""A Bit Closer to Heaven"". The game begins in January 2001, as New York City finishes experiencing the worst blizzard in its history. Max Payne (voiced by James McCaffrey) is seen standing at the top of a damaged skyscraper as police units arrive. He experiences a flashback to three years ago, when he came home to find his wife Michelle (Haviland Morris) and their newborn daughter Rose murdered by armed junkies, who were high on a new designer drug called Valkyr. After their funeral, a distraught Max left the NYPD and accepted an offer to join the DEA.
Three years later, Max is employed as an undercover operative inside the Punchinello Mafia family, which controls the trafficking of Valkyr. His DEA colleague, B.B. (Adam Grupper), arranges a meeting between Max and his friend and former handler, Alex Balder (Chris Phillips), in a subway station. Max accidentally gets in a shootout with mobsters working for Punchinello underboss Jack Lupino (Jeff Gurner), who are staging a bank robbery through an abandoned part of the subway. He eventually runs into Alex, only to witness him being killed by an assassin. Max becomes the prime suspect in Alex's murder, and is hunted by both the police and his former mob associates, who now know he's a cop.
While searching for Lupino, Max breaks up a Valkyr drug deal and discovers that Russian mobster Vladimir Lem (Dominic Hawksley) has started a war with the Punchinello family. After capturing Vinnie Gognitti (Joe Dallo), Lupino's right-hand man, Max interrogates him and learns Lupino is at his nightclub. Max eventually kills Lupino, and runs into Mona Sax (Julia Murney), a contract assassin and the sister-in-law of Don Angelo Punchinello (Joe Ragno). Mona, seeking revenge against Punchinello and not wanting Max to get in her way, gives him a drink laced with Valkyr. While experiencing a nightmare of the night his family was killed, Max is found by mobsters and taken away to be tortured, but manages to escape.
Max forms a partnership with Lem, who gives him a tip about a cargo ship at the Brooklyn waterfront carrying high-powered firearms, which some of Lem's former henchmen intend to sell to Punchinello. After securing the weapons, Max attempts to bargain with the Don, who leads him into an ambush at his restaurant. Surviving, Max storms Punchinello's manor and confronts the Don, but discovers that he is only a puppet in a bigger conspiracy. The manor is then overrun by soldiers working for pharmaceutical company Aesir, who kill Punchinello and leave Max for dead after injecting him with an overdose of Valkyr and setting the manor on fire. 
After experiencing another drug-induced nightmare, Max escapes from the manor, and heads to an old steel foundry where the soldiers are regrouping. There, he finds a hiddden underground military research complex, and discovers that Valkyr is the result of the ""Valhalla Project"", a Gulf War-era military experiment to improve soldiers' stamina and morale through chemical enhancements. The project was halted after a few years due to poor results, but was later secretly restarted by Nicole Horne (Jane Gennaro) through Aesir; when Michelle accidentally found out about Aesir's illegal experiments, Horne ordered her death. Max escapes from the bunker after Aesir initiates a self-destruct potrocol get rid of the evidence and witnesses, including their own men.
Later, Max, having figured out that B.B. is on Horne's payroll and killed Alex, agrees to meet him at a parking lot complex, where he kills him and his men. He is then called to meet a secret society known as the Inner Circle, who have been observing him. Their leader, Alfred Woden (John Randolph Jones), reveals that Horne was once a member, and asks Max to kill her in exchange for dealing with the charges against him. The meeting is then ambushed by Horne's men, but both Max and Woden survive. After escaping the attack, Max arrives at Aesir's headquarters and fights his way to the top. Along the way, he runs into Mona again, who has been hired by Horne to kill him; she refuses to do so and is shot, but survives and vanishes. Eventually, Max confronts Horne, who attempts to flee in her helicopter, but Max severs the guy wires of the building's antenna, causing it to crash into the helicopter and kill Horne. The game then returns to the openning scene: the NYPD storms the Aesir building and arrests Max. As he is taken into custody, he notices Woden among the crowd formed at the scene, and smiles, knowing that Woden will ensure his protection. 
","The player assumes the role of the titular character, with gameplay revolving around the use of the bullet time mechanic during firefights â when triggered, time is slowed down to such an extent that the speed at which bullets and other projectiles move is slow enough to be seen by the naked eye. Although Max's movement is also slowed, the player is still able to move and react in real-time, allowing them more time to plan and react to enemies.
Players are initially armed with a 9mm Beretta pistol, but as the game progresses, other weapons become available, with Max able to dual-wield some weapons for an increase in firepower at the cost of higher ammo consumption. When hurt, Max can replenish health by taking painkillers, which can be found in medical cabinets, lying around in levels, or taken from slain enemies.
The game's AI is dependent on scripted commands: most of the behavior exhibited by enemies (such as taking cover, retreating from the player, or throwing grenades) is scripted.[citation needed]
Progression through the levels is linear, occasionally incorporating small platforming and puzzle-solving elements. The game's storyline is often advanced in-game by the player following Max's internal monologue as the character determines what his next steps should be, breaking between â and sometimes within â levels in order to deliver larger story beats via graphic novel-styled interludes.
In addition to the standard game difficulty, ""Fugitive"", the game also features ""Hard-Boiled"", which increases damage taken while limiting health and ammo supplies; ""Dead on Arrival"", which limits the player to only seven saves per chapter; and ""New York Minute"", which forces the player to complete each chapter within an allotted time. Upon completing the game on ""Dead on Arrival"", the player unlocks ""The Last Challenge"" (also known as ""End Combat"" or ""Final Battle"" in other releases), which gives the player a select amount of painkillers, weapons, and ammunition, and puts them in a firefight with perpetual bullet time against the ""Killer Suit"" hitmen seen during the later parts of the game's campaign.

Maya the Bee: Sweet Gold|Die Biene Maja: SÃ¼Ães GoldGER,,2005,Shin'en,Midway,PAL,"Bonsels' original book contains fewer than 200 pages. The storyline is centered on the relation of Maya and her many adventures.
Maya is a bee born in a bee hive during internal unrest: the hive is dividing itself into two new colonies. Maya is raised by her teacher, Mrs. Cassandra. Despite Mrs. Cassandra's warnings, Maya wants to explore the wide world and commits the unforgivable crime of leaving the hive. During her adventures, Maya, now in exile, befriends other insects and braves dangers with them. In the climax of the book, Maya is taken prisoner by hornets, the bees' sworn enemies.
Prisoner of the hornets, Maya learns of a hornet plan to attack her native hive. Maya is faced with the decision to either return to hive and suffer her due punishment, saving the hive, or leaving the plan unannounced, saving herself but destroying the hive. After severe pondering, she makes the decision to return. In the hive, she announces the coming attack and is, totally unexpectedly, pardoned. The forewarned bees triumph over the hornet attack force. Maya, now a heroine of the hive, becomes a teacher like Mrs. Cassandra and shares her experiences and wisdom with the future generation.
It has been suggested[by whom?] that the book may have carried a political message, analogous to Jean de La Fontaine's or Ivan Krylov's work. According to this view, Maya represents the ideal citizen, and the beehive represents a well-organised militarist society. It has also elements of nationalism and speciesism. Maya gets angry in two instances. First, a grasshopper fails to distinguish between bees and wasps. Maya's verbal response includes calling the wasps ""a useless gang of bandits"" [RÃ¤ubergeschlecht] that have no ""home or faith"" [Heimat und Glauben]. Second, a fly calls Maya an idiot, which prompts Maya to shout that she's going to teach ""respect for bees"" and to threaten the fly with her stinger. The critic[who?] interprets this to mean that respect is based on the threat of violence. Collectivism versus individualism is also a theme. Maya's independence and departure from the beehive is seen as reproachable, but it is atoned by her warning of the hornets' attack. This show of loyalty restores her position in the society. In the hornet attack part of the story, the bees' will to defend the hive and the heroic deaths of bee officers are glorified, often in overtly militarist tones.[8]
In the post-WWII adaptations, the militarist element was toned down considerably, the hornets' role reduced, and the character of Willy, a lazy and quite un-warlike drone bee, was introduced (he does not appear in the novel). In the cartoon series, the briskly marching, but ridiculously incompetent ant armies provide a parody of militarism.

Mazes of Fate,,2006,Sabarasa Entertainment,O3 Entertainment,,"The dark fantasy world where the story is set is soon to be facing divine punishment. The ancient gods, disgusted by humanityâs pride, intend to wipe mankind out and replace it with a new, more submissive race of goatmen, but this plan is not unavoidable. One party of adventurers take it upon themselves to fight back ""against overwhelming odds"" so that humanity is not sentenced to a fate ""that may be worse than death.""[5]
Traveling with the protagonist are potentially six allies, who gradually get recruited, or ask to join the adventurers.[5]
","Mazes of Fate is a real-time first-person role-playing game in which the player takes controls of up to three characters. It bears similarities to older games in its genre, including Eye of the Beholder. When the player starts the game, he or she can either choose from three different pre-generated characters - a Warrior, a Rogue, and a Mage - or create a custom character. The Warrior's abilities are tilted towards power, the Rogue's abilities are tilted towards speed and thief-related abilities, and the Mage's abilities are tilted towards magic and spells. In the DS version of the game, the number of pre-generated characters player may choose from is increased to seven. In addition to the original three characters, he or she can also play as a Priest, an Assassin (an agile warrior using mostly daggers and knives), a Valkyrie (a different type of warrior specializing in two-handed and ranged weapons), or as an alternative type of Warrior specializing in two-handed weapons.The game has three different types of areas the player can explore - dungeons, the overworld, and civilized locations. The dungeons are the primary area where battles are fought, the overworld is a hub which leads to dungeons and civilized locations, and civilized locations often act to advance the story and purchase and sell items.

Medabots AX: Metabee Version|Medarot G: Kabuto VersionJP,Yes,20022003,Natsume,Natsume,"NA, PAL, JP","The series centers around Medabots, artificially intelligent robots, whose purpose is to serve humans in a future time. The series begins with a ten-year-old (nine in the Japanese version) boy named Ikki TenryÅ, who wants to become a champion of the World Robattle Tournament. However, Ikki is unable to afford a Medabot, and his parents refuse to buy him one. However, he manages to get enough money to buy an outdated model, and, with a bit of luck, he finds a medal in a river. Ikki quickly inserts it into the Medabot he purchased named Metabee. The only problem is that the medal he found gives Metabee a severe attitude problem (a problem rarely seen in a Medabot), which leads Ikki to think he is defective. However, this theory is proven wrong later in the series, as it is revealed that Metabee actually has a ""rare"" medal.
The rare medals were kept secret by the Medabot Corporation, as very little was known about them. However, a Medabot with a rare medal would be able to call upon an attack called the ""Medaforce"". In the manga, the Medaforce is a form of medal mind control, as explained by Dr. Aki in the third graphic novel of Medabots. In the cartoon however, it is shown as a way of increasing the power of the Medabot's special skill into a focused beam attack.
Another important aspect is the story of Henry, the store clerk who sold Ikki  Metabee. It is revealed that he is, quite obviously, Phantom Renegade. A running gag of the series was Henry almost telling everyone he is The Phantom, with no one ever discovering this fact. Space Medafighter X is introduced, who is another one of Henry's secret identities, the number one medafighter in Japan. Later, during the World Finals, he rarely shows up to the fights, instead sending substitutes and working behind the scenes. This being because he supposedly started The Ten Days of Darkness, which occurred eight years before the events in the series during the World Robattle Cup when Henry fought as Hikaru Agata with the original Metabee (however, the medal was different). The Medabots went on a rampage during the Ten Days of Darkness, which stopped when Henry was forced to kill his Medabot by destroying his medal.
At the end of the second season, it is revealed that Victor (a medafighter for Team Kenya and Warbandit's owner) was helping Dr. Meta-evil to get medals during the tournament. During the finals, Metabee and Warbandit continue to fight, even with their partners lost and their bodies damaged. It is during this event that Dr. Meta-evil starts his plan using Metabee and Warbandit's medals; trapping them both in a dream. However, Ikki manages to get Metabee to wake up from the dream, while the other medabots, free now, help Metabee to fight against Dr. Meta-evil. Ikki must also stop the plans of the nefarious ""RubberRobo Gang"".
Later in the series, Medabots are found to be actually thousands of years old; remnants of an ancient civilization who called themselves Medalorians. The Medalorians were obsessed with war, and to become more effective warriors they fastened metal armor to themselves. However, their wars decimated the civilization, and the survivors coded their memories onto hexagonal pieces of metal. These, ""Medals"", cloned and mass-produced by the Medabot Corporation (a corporation founded by Dr. Aki), are the Medabot equivalent of a brain and soul. The original medals, referred to as ""rare"" medals, are kept in storage because of the extreme power they have.
Medarot Damashii, a sequel to the original series, follows Ikki and Metabee, as they face a new challenge following the events of the original series.  Kam Kamazaki, a twelve-year-old boy, has designed one of the most dangerous medabots in the entire story, called Kilobots (or Death Medarot, in the Japanese version), who use the X-Medal. These Kilobots have no feelings, since the emotion part of the Medabot medal has been removed, and more strength parts have been replaced instead, and can break the rules in order to win a fight.  Because they have no personality, the Medaforce is useless against them.  In the first episode, Ikki loses a Robattle  to Ginkai and his Kilobot when it cheats and reloads. But he soon meets Nae, a Medabot mechanic and Dr. Aki's granddaughter, who gives Ikki new medaparts in order to defeat the kilobot through using a new feature called Action Mode (later Demolition Mode is introduced as well).  Throughout the season, Ikki, Erika and their new friend Zuru (who also masks as the Mystery Medafighter) battle several of Kam's friends and their Kilobots.  The Mystery Medfighter's ambition is to rid the world of Kilobots, with the help of his medabot Roks.  Eventually, Ginkai re-discovers the true spirit of medafighting and ceases being a rogue medafighter and returns to using Medabots. Eventually Kam realizes the error of his ways and stops trying to develop stronger and more dangerous Kilobots, choosing to remain with his Kilobot Blackbettle, who has a personality installed into her medal.
The series is often criticized for the removal of several supporting characters such as Henry/Hikaru Agata/Phantom Renegade/Space Medafighter X and Arcbeetle, Rokusho, Koji and Sumilidon, Rintaro and Kantaroth, Karin and Neutranurse, Victor and Warbandit, Mr. Referee, the Rubberrobo Gang and the Chick Salesman, as well as for the fact that many of the new Kilobots and Medabots are simply slightly modified versions of the original series without relation to the original characters: Roks (Rokusho), Exor (Sumilidon), Arcdash (Arcbeetle), Unitrix (Warbandit).

In the cartoon however, it is shown as a way of increasing the power of the Medabot's special skill into a focused beam attack.
Another important aspect is the story of Henry, the store clerk who sold Ikki  Metabee. It is revealed that he is, quite obviously, Phantom Renegade. A running gag of the series was Henry almost telling everyone he is The Phantom, with no one ever discovering this fact. Space Medafighter X is introduced, who is another one of Henry's secret identities, the number one medafighter in Japan. Later, during the World Finals, he rarely shows up to the fights, instead sending substitutes and working behind the scenes. This being because he supposedly started The Ten Days of Darkness, which occurred eight years before the events in the series during the World Robattle Cup when Henry fought as Hikaru Agata with the original Metabee (however, the medal was different). The Medabots went on a rampage during the Ten Days of Darkness, which stopped when Henry was forced to kill his Medabot by destroying his medal.
At the end of the second season, it is revealed that Victor (a medafighter for Team Kenya and Warbandit's owner) was helping Dr. Meta-evil to get medals during the tournament. During the finals, Metabee and Warbandit continue to fight, even with their partners lost and their bodies damaged. It is during this event that Dr. Meta-evil starts his plan using Metabee and Warbandit's medals; trapping them both in a dream. However, Ikki manages to get Metabee to wake up from the dream, while the other medabots, free now, help Metabee to fight against Dr. Meta-evil. Ikki must also stop the plans of the nefarious ""RubberRobo Gang"".
Later in the series, Medabots are found to be actually thousands of years old; remnants of an ancient civilization who called themselves Medalorians. The Medalorians were obsessed with war, and to become more effective warriors they fastened metal armor to themselves. However, their wars decimated the civilization, and the survivors coded their memories onto hexagonal pieces of metal. These, ""Medals"", cloned and mass-produced by the Medabot Corporation (a corporation founded by Dr. Aki), are the Medabot equivalent of a brain and soul. The original medals, referred to as ""rare"" medals, are kept in storage because of the extreme power they have.
Medarot Damashii, a sequel to the original series, follows Ikki and Metabee, as they face a new challenge following the events of the original series.  Kam Kamazaki, a twelve-year-old boy, has designed one of the most dangerous medabots in the entire story, called Kilobots (or Death Medarot, in the Japanese version), who use the X-Medal. These Kilobots have no feelings, since the emotion part of the Medabot medal has been removed, and more strength parts have been replaced instead, and can break the rules in order to win a fight.  Because they have no personality, the Medaforce is useless against them.  In the first episode, Ikki loses a Robattle  to Ginkai and his Kilobot when it cheats and reloads. But he soon meets Nae, a Medabot mechanic and Dr. Aki's granddaughter, who gives Ikki new medaparts in order to defeat the kilobot through using a new feature called Action Mode (later Demolition Mode is introduced as well).  Throughout the season, Ikki, Erika and their new friend Zuru (who also masks as the Mystery Medafighter) battle several of Kam's friends and their Kilobots.  The Mystery Medfighter's ambition is to rid the world of Kilobots, with the help of his medabot Roks.  Eventually, Ginkai re-discovers the true spirit of medafighting and ceases being a rogue medafighter and returns to using Medabots. Eventually Kam realizes the error of his ways and stops trying to develop stronger and more dangerous Kilobots, choosing to remain with his Kilobot Blackbettle, who has a personality installed into her medal.
The series is often criticized for the removal of several supporting characters such as Henry/Hikaru Agata/Phantom Renegade/Space Medafighter X and Arcbeetle, Rokusho, Koji and Sumilidon, Rintaro and Kantaroth, Karin and Neutranurse, Victor and Warbandit, Mr. Referee, the Rubberrobo Gang and the Chick Salesman, as well as for the fact that many of the new Kilobots and Medabots are simply slightly modified versions of the original series without relation to the original characters: Roks (Rokusho), Exor (Sumilidon), Arcdash (Arcbeetle), Unitrix (Warbandit).

Mega Man & Bass|Rockman & ForteJP,,2001,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","The story of Mega Man & Bass varies slightly depending on which player character is chosen. It begins one year after the events of Mega Man 8 when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light.[1] Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him.[2] Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data, instructing his minions to handle the heroes. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans.
After vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species.[3] The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor.[4] When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his ""brainwashing level"" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him, but not before the latter teleports Proto Man out of his castle. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.
Mega Man and Bass confront Dr. Wily in his newly regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities.[5] Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Wily then demands Bass to destroy Proto Man, but Bass is unsure. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight.[6] Bass doesn't care and forces Proto Man to leave, saying that he will still destroy Mega Man to prove his cause. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King, who has somehow escaped the destruction of his castle. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were to meet in the future.
","The gameplay in Mega Man & Bass is similar to earlier games in the series. The player is tasked with completing a series of action-platform stages while overcoming obstacles, solving minor puzzles, and battling enemies. Destroying the ""Robot Master"" boss at the end of a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon.[1][7] In previous games, the player generally took on the role of the hero Mega Man. In this game, the player can choose to start the game as either Mega Man or Bass. However, whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed.[8] Mega Man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground.[1][7] Bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions, though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained.[7] Bass is also able to double-jump (jump a second time in mid-air) and dash along the ground.[1] Performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash-jump.
The stage structure is different from other games in the series. After the introduction level, the player can only choose between three Robot Masters.[1][9] Defeating Cold Man unlocks Burner Man and Pirate Man; defeating Astro Man unlocks Dynamo Man, Tengu Man, and Pirate Man; and defeating Ground Man unlocks Magic Man and Tengu Man. Clearing one of these unlocked stages opens the way to a security room where the player must destroy a series of crystals with obtained Robot Master weapons.  Bypassing all eight crystals opens the way to the fortress stages. In a similar fashion to previous installments in the series, enemies often drop bolts after they are destroyed, and these can be exchanged for various restorative items and upgrades.  However, unlike in Mega Man 7 the security cavern offers a way to obtain large amounts of bolts without having to repeatedly visit stages.[1] Some upgrades are unique to either character, such as Mega Man's ability to call on his dog Rush to search for items, or an adaptor for Bass to combine with his wolf Treble to temporarily fly.[1] Also distributed throughout the introduction and Robot Master levels are a collection of 100 data CDs that contain information on many prominent characters in the series. Most of the CDs are hidden either behind obstacles that need to be destroyed with a special weapon or accessed with a character-specific ability, making it impossible to collect them all on a single playthrough.[7] CDs collected in each playthrough are permanently placed in a database and remain unlocked after beating the game. Saved games are used in place of the series' traditional password system.[1]

Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge|Rockman EXE Battle Chip GPJP,,20032004,Capcom,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","The plot of Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge involves the opening of a new netbattling tournament known as the ""Battle Chip GP"". Yai is sponsoring the event while the others enter it. Even Chaud enters the tournament, but only for official business. It turns out that there is some type of new organization behind the scenes of the tournament who will delete the winning Navi and take its data for themselves.
","Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge utilizes a different battle system from other Battle Network titles. In those games, the player may battle one or more enemies in real-time by utilizing special abilities called ""Battle Chips"" with the objective being to delete each enemy's hit points (HP). In this game, the player duels a single opponent simply by setting up 12 Battle Chips on a grid called a ""Program Deck"". The Program Deck has three columns of chips, with the first column having two chips, the second having three chips, and the last having four chips.[6] The game selects three chips at random on one of the grid's rows, and the player's Navi uses them consecutively, ending the turn with that character's signature attack.[7] Battle Chips have a variety of effects such as attacking, healing, and elemental status changes.[7] ""Navi Chips"" will even summon other characters into the battle for a short time. After setting the deck, the player has little control over the match. Battles progress almost completely autonomously for upwards of ten rounds while the player watches for results. At certain points during the fight, the player may ""Slot In"" two chips to change the outcome of the battle.[6][8][9]
One possible outcome of a turn is the destruction of an opponent's Battle Chips. Certain types of attacks not only do damage to an opponent's HP, but to their Program Deck as well, as each chip also has a set amount of HP.[8] The player can win fights not only by utilizing power, but by deleting an opponents entire deck, making them unable to fight. If ten turns pass and neither competitor has lost all of their HP, the game determines the winner based on how many chips are left in their decks.[7] The game also has an ""Open Battle"" feature in the game that allows the player to select a certain area with a set amount of consecutive battles to fight. Winning every fifth battle in one of these earns the player a new Navi Chip to use as well as a variable amount of ""Zenny"", the game's currency. Zenny can be used to purchase more chips from the character Higsby in the game's multiple shops.[9] The game contains six different playable pairs of operators and their NetNavis including Lan and MegaMan, Dex and GutsMan, Mayl and Roll, and Chaud and ProtoMan. There are also two new duos: Kai and Turboman, and Mary and Ring. A multiplayer feature allows up to two players connect their GBAs for battles.[8]

Mega Man Battle Network|Battle Network Rockman EXJP,Yes,"20010320010321March 21, 2001Â (JP)October 30, 2001Â (US)November 30, 2001Â (EU)",,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","Mega Man Battle Network is set in an ambiguous year in the 21st century (""20XX AD"") in an alternate reality to the original Mega Man series.[6] Within the world of Battle Network, the Net  has become humanity's primary means of communication, commerce, and even crime. Users are able to ""jack in"" to the Net and other computerized devices, and explore their various aspects using program avatars called ""NetNavis (Network Navigators)"" as if they were physical locations.[7] The Net and the inner workings of computers are displayed as a virtual world with which computer programs of all varieties, as personified in a humanoid form, can interact. Users often do so by accessing their NetNavis via a ""PET (PErsonal information Terminal)"" device.[7] The plot of Mega Man Battle Network follows one such pair, Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. Lan is a fifth grader in the town of ACDC.[7] His father, Dr. Yuichiro Hikari, is one of the world's top scientists and NetNavi researchers. Not long into the story, Lan and MegaMan.EXE take it upon themselves to solve various criminal cases around ACDC involving other Navis and their operators. Some of the confrontations with the various criminals involve desperate, life-threatening situations including a bus rigged to explode, oxygen being cut off at a large party, the entire city's clean water freezing, and school students being re-educated as mindless slaves. The duo continuously crosses paths with Eugene Chaud, an official ""NetBattler"" commissioned by the government to investigate crimes on the Net.[8] Chaud and his NetNavi ProtoMan.EXE act as rivals to Lan and MegaMan.EXE.
The protagonists eventually learn that the criminals are all connected to an organization called the ""WWW (World Three)"". The WWW intentionally infects computer networks with computer viruses so as to hinder their normal operations and hack vital information. The group is led by Dr. Wily, a former colleague of Lan's grandfather. While working together, Wily had specialized in robotics while Lan's grandfather specialized in networks, which eventually led to NetNavis.[9] The government cut Wily's funding, opting instead to pursue Hikari's NetNavi project. Wily's goal throughout the game is to collect four super programs with which the ""LifeVirus"" may be constructed.[10] The LifeVirus is a nearly indestructible virus capable of wiping out the Net and all associated devices. The protagonists infiltrate the WWW, but MegaMan.EXE becomes disabled. Chaud arrives and gives Lan a batch file from Dr. Hikari to restore his Navi. After receiving the file ""Hub.bat"", Lan questions his father about the name. It is revealed the MegaMan.EXE is actually a unique Navi made by Lan's father. When Lan's twin brother, Hub, died at a young age, Dr. Hikari transferred Hub's consciousness into the NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. This created a special physical and virtual bond between the two brothers.[6][11] In the end, Lan and MegaMan.EXE manage to defeat Wily, destroy the LifeVirus, and restore peace to ACDC.
","Unlike the previous action-platformer entries of the Mega Man franchise, Mega Man Battle Network is a real-time tactical RPG. To progress through the game the player must alternately navigate the outside world as Lan Hikari and the Net as MegaMan.EXE, each containing certain tasks that must be completed to allow advancement in the other.[12] Controlling Lan, the player may travel around the world map, interact with non-player characters, check email, purchase items, initiate Net missions, or speak with MegaMan.EXE through his PET.[7] In contrast with traditional Mega Man entries in which battle and movement through the levels happen in the same setting, Battle Network's combat occurs only through by battling computer viruses within the Net. This cyber world is represented by a series of branching pathways and nodes, where MegaMan.EXE can travel to both new and previously visited locations, find and purchase items, and fight viruses. Battles do not generally appear on the field screen of the Net but are usually set as random encounters.[13] The battlefield itself is made up of 18 tiles divided into two groups of nine, one group being space in which MegaMan.EXE may freely move and the other group being space inhabited by enemies.[6][7][14] Akin to other Mega Man games, MegaMan.EXE possesses an arm cannon called the ""Mega Buster"". The player can transition among the nine provided tiles and fire the Mega Buster at enemies from across the screen. The objective of each battle is to delete all the viruses by reducing their hit points (HP) to zero.[7] If MegaMan.EXE's own health depletes, a game over occurs. Certain power-up programs can be found that upgrade MegaMan.EXE's HP, defense, or Mega Buster power.[7][13]
The Mega Buster is quite weak on its own, so in order to delete viruses more efficiently, the player must access special abilities called ""Battle Chips"".[6][12] These are minor programs that contain data that the Navi can utilize to perform more powerful attacks, summon other Navis for help, or execute supportive actions such as restoring HP or destroying tiles on the enemies' side of the battlefield.[6][7][14][15] Battle Chips are uploaded to MegaMan.EXE by Lan's PET in a process called ""Customization."" Each turn in battle presents the player with five random chips from which to choose, though the player is limited to chips of the same variety or chips with the same alphabetic code.[7][15] Once the ""Battle Gauge"" (or ""Custom Gauge"") at the top of the screen fills during battle, another random set of chips can be chosen from a general pool called the ""folder"".[7][14] At any given time, the player may only have exactly 30 chips in the folder from which the Customization process may draw.[6] The player is only allowed to carry up to ten of the same kind of chip and up to five Navi-summon chips in the folder.[7] However, a player may possess any number of other chips in inactive reserve, called the ""sack"", which may be moved to the active folder outside of battle. Every chip and enemy is aligned to one of five elements: Neutral, Fire, Water, Electric, and Wood. If MegaMan.EXE hits an enemy with an attack aligned to an element they are weak against, the attack will do double damage.[7]
Battle Network features a very limited multiplayer option. Up to two players may connect with each other using a Game Link Cable and then give or trade Battle Chips. Players may also engage in battles with one another.[7][12][15] The ""test battle"" mode has no stakes whereas the ""real battle"" mode allows the winning player to take a battle chip from the loser.[7]

Mega Man Battle Network 2|Battle Network Rockman EXE 2JP,,20012002,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The general gameplay is essentially identical to that of the original Mega Man Battle Network game; indeed, the two games utilize a significant amount of the same graphics. However, Battle Network 2 introduces several new concepts that augment the original game-system.
In terms of health, Mega Man no longer heals fully and automatically after each battle. Furthermore, the game introduces the SubChip, a device similar in basic concept to a battle chip but one that can only be activated outside of battle.
Where in the original, a player had only one chip folder, Battle Network 2 introduces the possibility of alternate active folders, allowing players to easily customize their range of possible attacks to conform to multiple situations. Notably, chips used in one active folder are not available for the construction of a second, even though only one folder may be used at any given time. Up to three folders can be found in this game, and all are fully customizable. As in the previous game, folders may have up to five Navi chips each and only five of the same kind of any chip (the first game allowed up to ten of the same non-Navi chip).
Aside from the addition of new Battle Chips in general, Battle Network 2 expanded the old chip code system, which had previously been limited only to the alphabet. Some Chips could occur with an asterisk (*) as their code letter, a wild card symbol meaning the Chip can be used with any other Chip. This game is the only Battle Network game (besides 6) where it is possible (from one chip trader only) to get * coded Navi chips. There are now 250 chips possible in single player mode, with chips 251-260 possible only via NetBattling, and chip #261 (Sanctuary) earned when the player completes Hard Mode. Players can also now earn up to five stars on the title screen by completing major tasks in the game.
Additionally, players may access NetSquares in the game. These places serve as a sort of Town Square for NetNavis and their operators to relax, buy supplies, and exchange information.
One final change was the replacement of the old armor system, which only affected damage received, with a style system that affects damage received, attack damage, physical appearance, among other benefits. During the course of the game MegaMan may take on one of five Styles (Guts, Team, Custom, Shield, and Hub), each of which will also be aligned with one of four elements (Heat, Wood, Elec, and Aqua). He can store up to two styles in his memory at once and change out when not battling.
Starting with Battle Network 2, anytime a chip trader is used, the game will automatically save when the player receives their new chip. This is to prevent the player from cheating by simply soft resetting without saving until the chip trader gives out a desirable chip, which was possible in the first game. Another chip trader tradition that starts with this game and continues on for the remainder of the series is that there is one ten chip trader that will appear only upon completing Story Mode (yellow star), and gives out the best chips of all the chip traders.

Mega Man Battle Network 3: Blue|Battle Network Rockman EXE 3 BlackJP,,2003,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The gameplay in Battle Network 3 is similar to that of its predecessors, with few graphical enhancements and minor gameplay changes. Battle Network 3 saw the removal of Power-Ups that were  collected to improve the MegaBuster - instead the Navi Customizer was added, allowing abilities to be added on with certain rules as to how these abilities can be added with respect to each other.
Each version of the game has a separate Contest Navi: BowlMan for Blue/Black, and MistMan for White.  Blue also includes another Navi, Punk, that could be challenged from time to time. Punk's chip was only available as part of a special promotion in Japan. However, it can be attained via a cheat device or by being traded from Black to Blue.  White, on the other hand, has no such Navi.
In Battle Network 3 the virus breeder is available, where special, friendly viruses (that must be found first somewhere in the net) are kept and can be fed using BugFrags. When a virus is found and put in the breeder, a chip for that virus is obtained. Feeding each virus BugFrags levels up their chip accordingly. After a family of a certain type of virus has been fed to the max, they will release information to the player as to where the Omega Virus of that family (i.e. For the KillerEye family, they will give you a clue to find KillerEye Omega) can be found. After the Omega Virus of that family is found and deleted, it will join the others in the Virus Breeder and will be available when the corresponding Virus Chip is used. This is the only Battle Network game that features non-Navi Omega viruses.
Battle Network 3 introduces further classification of Battle Chips by splitting them into three categories: 200 white Standard chips, 85 blue Mega chips and 25 pink Giga chips. Standard Chips are limited to only four of each kind (even if letter codes are different) per folder. Mega Chips are limited to only five per folder, and only one of each kind. Only one Giga Chip is allowed per folder and only one copy of each Giga chip exists throughout the entire game. These specifications would continue for the remainder of the series. There are certain types of programs (see Navi Customizer) that can boost the Mega and Giga chip limits, though. There are five unique Giga chips exclusive to each version and this would continue for the remainder of the series, although Battle Network 5 offers six Giga chips per version. There are also Program advances which are a combination of three or four chips.
Multiplayer is accessible from the Comm option on the Main Menu. Multiplayer, also called ""Netbattling"", allows two players to fight head to head with their respective Megaman.EXEs (this includes style-changes and health, as well as Navi customizer stats). When you enter the Multiplayer screen, the player can choose from Netbattling, Trading Chips, and Comparing Libraries.
By choosing the Netbattling option from the Comm menu, a player is given two options again, Practice and Real. Practice allows two players to battle with no risk of losing chips, and does not count against your Win/Loss record. In Real, matches count for win-loss records and the losing player in a Netbattle forfeits a chip randomly chosen from their chip pack. There is a special Giga-Chip that is attained in this fashion (DeltaRayEdge Z for Blue, Balance Y for White), which has a 1/32 chance of happening instead of the winning player acquiring the other player's chip. For these chips to be attained, both players MUST have at least one star and you must be battling in midweight or heavyweight, real. After choosing Practice/Real, players can choose Lightweight, Midweight, and Heavyweight. Lightweight allows players to battle on a level field, with no negative panels on either side. Midweight may give certain obstacles on either player's side of the field, such as Rockcubes and plain Rocks. Panels may also be cracked or broken. Heavyweight is guaranteed to have negative panels on both sides, and some matches contain rapidly replenishing Guardians, which deal 200 damage (400 on ice or to aqua style, 800 to an aqua style on ice) to a player who hits them.
Players can also trade Battle Chips with other players. No Giga Chip can be traded. Trading is required to attain all seven stars in the game, due to the lack of Mistman in blue version and Bowlman in white version. The ""Comparing Libraries"" option scans both players' libraries. If one player has a Battle Chip that the other player does not, the other player shall attain a blank spot in the library that represents that chip. From here, the player can buy that Chip from Higsby's shop in ACDC Town after the defeat of Beastman; using the Order System. Giga Chips cannot be bought from Higsby's Shop.

Mega Man Battle Network 3: White|Battle Network Rockman EXE 3JP,,2004,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The gameplay in Battle Network 3 is similar to that of its predecessors, with few graphical enhancements and minor gameplay changes. Battle Network 3 saw the removal of Power-Ups that were  collected to improve the MegaBuster - instead the Navi Customizer was added, allowing abilities to be added on with certain rules as to how these abilities can be added with respect to each other.
Each version of the game has a separate Contest Navi: BowlMan for Blue/Black, and MistMan for White.  Blue also includes another Navi, Punk, that could be challenged from time to time. Punk's chip was only available as part of a special promotion in Japan. However, it can be attained via a cheat device or by being traded from Black to Blue.  White, on the other hand, has no such Navi.
In Battle Network 3 the virus breeder is available, where special, friendly viruses (that must be found first somewhere in the net) are kept and can be fed using BugFrags. When a virus is found and put in the breeder, a chip for that virus is obtained. Feeding each virus BugFrags levels up their chip accordingly. After a family of a certain type of virus has been fed to the max, they will release information to the player as to where the Omega Virus of that family (i.e. For the KillerEye family, they will give you a clue to find KillerEye Omega) can be found. After the Omega Virus of that family is found and deleted, it will join the others in the Virus Breeder and will be available when the corresponding Virus Chip is used. This is the only Battle Network game that features non-Navi Omega viruses.
Battle Network 3 introduces further classification of Battle Chips by splitting them into three categories: 200 white Standard chips, 85 blue Mega chips and 25 pink Giga chips. Standard Chips are limited to only four of each kind (even if letter codes are different) per folder. Mega Chips are limited to only five per folder, and only one of each kind. Only one Giga Chip is allowed per folder and only one copy of each Giga chip exists throughout the entire game. These specifications would continue for the remainder of the series. There are certain types of programs (see Navi Customizer) that can boost the Mega and Giga chip limits, though. There are five unique Giga chips exclusive to each version and this would continue for the remainder of the series, although Battle Network 5 offers six Giga chips per version. There are also Program advances which are a combination of three or four chips.
Multiplayer is accessible from the Comm option on the Main Menu. Multiplayer, also called ""Netbattling"", allows two players to fight head to head with their respective Megaman.EXEs (this includes style-changes and health, as well as Navi customizer stats). When you enter the Multiplayer screen, the player can choose from Netbattling, Trading Chips, and Comparing Libraries.
By choosing the Netbattling option from the Comm menu, a player is given two options again, Practice and Real. Practice allows two players to battle with no risk of losing chips, and does not count against your Win/Loss record. In Real, matches count for win-loss records and the losing player in a Netbattle forfeits a chip randomly chosen from their chip pack. There is a special Giga-Chip that is attained in this fashion (DeltaRayEdge Z for Blue, Balance Y for White), which has a 1/32 chance of happening instead of the winning player acquiring the other player's chip. For these chips to be attained, both players MUST have at least one star and you must be battling in midweight or heavyweight, real. After choosing Practice/Real, players can choose Lightweight, Midweight, and Heavyweight. Lightweight allows players to battle on a level field, with no negative panels on either side. Midweight may give certain obstacles on either player's side of the field, such as Rockcubes and plain Rocks. Panels may also be cracked or broken. Heavyweight is guaranteed to have negative panels on both sides, and some matches contain rapidly replenishing Guardians, which deal 200 damage (400 on ice or to aqua style, 800 to an aqua style on ice) to a player who hits them.
Players can also trade Battle Chips with other players. No Giga Chip can be traded. Trading is required to attain all seven stars in the game, due to the lack of Mistman in blue version and Bowlman in white version. The ""Comparing Libraries"" option scans both players' libraries. If one player has a Battle Chip that the other player does not, the other player shall attain a blank spot in the library that represents that chip. From here, the player can buy that Chip from Higsby's shop in ACDC Town after the defeat of Beastman; using the Order System. Giga Chips cannot be bought from Higsby's Shop.

Mega Man Battle Network 4: Blue Moon|Rockman EXE 4 Tournament Blue MoonJP,,2004,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","The beginning of the game shows the player at a space research center known in-game as NAXA. Scientists have discovered a massive asteroid speeding toward the earth that, if made contact with, would end all life on earth. 
The game then cuts to the protagonists, Lan Hikari and MegaMan.EXE (in this continuity a Network Navigator or NetNavi, an in-universe AI program), going shopping with their father. While in the electronics district, they find themselves pitted against a NetNavi known as ShadeMan, portrayed as having strong dark powers. Upon defeating ShadeMan, he disappears, dropping unknown data. It is revealed to Lan and MegaMan to be a DarkChip, a program described as unleashing great power at the cost of the Navi's soul (their goodness and well-being). The duo are warned to never use it under any circumstances.
The game cuts back to the scientists, who are now joined by some of the best scientists and researchers of various countries, including the duo's father. They come to the conclusion that the best way to avoid impact with the asteroid is to use a laser to move it off-course.
The game again changes to the perspective of the protagonists. The next in-game day, after the ShadeMan incident, Lan and MegaMan participate in the Den Battle Tournament, the local NetBattle tournament, and become the champions. After completing the tourney, they return home to find it burglarized by someone connected to the DarkChip. Upon investigation, they discover that the DarkChip Syndicate Nebula was behind the attack of their home, looking for the DarkChip the two possess. After defeating a Nebula member in battle, he warns the duo that the syndicate has their eye on them and the DarkChip.
With no leads to go on, the pair decide to go to the amusement park, only to find the animatronics going haywire. Lan and MegaMan find ShadeMan in one of the animatronic animals. In order to best ShadeMan, MegaMan has no other option but to use the DarkChip. 
Now, without the DarkChip or ShadeMan, the duo decide to enter the Eagle/Hawk Tournament held by the amusement park. The team emerge victorious once again. After the tournament, they meet LaserMan, the leader Navi of Nebula, who shows MegaMan the DarkSoul lurking within him now that he has used a DarkChip.
Meanwhile, the scientists fire the laser at the asteroid, but it fails. One of the scientists, Dr. Regal, claims to have an idea and asks for a world-class Net Operator and Navi.
Naturally, Lan and MegaMan are invited to the Red Sun/Blue Moon Tournament, a competition explained as putting together the best of the best of NetBattlers. After winning the tourney, the duo are taken to NAXA and are briefed on the situation. It is explained that the asteroid has a computer in it and can be steered away from the planet. Before Lan has the chance to send MegaMan to the asteroid, Dr. Regal reveals himself as the leader of Nebula and had been planning all along to use the asteroid in his plan for world domination. Still, Lan is able to send MegaMan, where he once again meets LaserMan, as well as Duo, the Operating System of the asteroid. MegaMan defeats both of them and convinces Duo that the planet is worthy enough to not be destroyed. The asteroid leaves, and Regal appeared to have committed suicide in order to avoid legal prosecution, but was revealed to be alive in the sequel.[1] Once again, Lan and MegaMan have saved the world from the latest crisis.
","Battle Network 4 greatly differs from Battle Network 3 in many ways, the most notable of which is the concept of DoubleSoul (Soul Unison in the original).  DoubleSoul is similar to how the classic-style Mega Man could acquire the weapons of the Robot Masters that he has defeated: by using DoubleSoul, Mega Man.EXE could use the powers of other NetNavis in the same manner as how classic Mega Man could use the powers of the Robot Masters through their weapons.  To perform a DoubleSoul, which lasts for a temporary amount of time (three turns), however, a chip must be sacrificed for the battle.
Another key feature is that it takes a minimum of three playthroughs of the game's main story mode in order to uncover all of its secrets - although many criticize the game for the same reason.  After each playthrough, a player is permitted to either continue with their existing game or to start a new game at a higher level of difficulty, although any save at a higher level of difficulty will overwrite a save of the lower level. Thus, it is very important for those players who want to collect all chips and power-ups to be sure that all blue/purple mystery datas and all V1 virus' chips and program advances have been collected before starting Level 2.  The same is true for going on to Level 3.
Finally, DarkChips, which are powerful chips resulting in a host of negative side-effects, make their debut in this game: a mood indicator in the corner of the screen shows the mood of MegaMan, and should the mood change to a negative one, random DarkChips will appear in Mega Man's Custom Screen. Each DarkChip will have many negative (and notable permanent) side-effects, that taint MegaMan's own soul with darkness.  Should the darkness overwhelm MegaMan, he will find  a different selection of chips are made available to use, with a different selection of Program Advances (like the infamous ""DarkNeo"" Program Advance, which involves the Bass GigaChip) therein. Also, when you use a DarkChip (aside from the battle with Shade Man in the ToyRobo and in free tournaments at Higsby's shop), Mega Man permanently loses 1 HP for each and cannot regain all HP lost, even if you were to purify yourself. There are also special chips (like the 5 evil chips) that can only be used if Mega Man is completely consumed by dark power.  Conversely, if Mega Man does enough battles (about 1000) without ever using a Dark Chip, he will turn brighter in color and allow him to more easily achieve Full Synchro mode.
The Emotion Window is a mood indicator that lets the operator know Mega Man's current state based on fighting performance. The window also changes whenever DoubleSoul is used, to a mugshot of the corresponding Soul used.
Full Synchro is a heightened state of focus gained by performing a counter-attack against a virus (I.e. attacking the virus just before it attacks). In this state, Battlechip attacks are doubled in strength. It is possible to consecutively achieve Full Synchro by continuously counter-attacking and thus doubling effectiveness in battle. Full Synchro expires when the player fails to counter-attack a virus, or when MegaMan suffers damage.
Conversely, when a fight is not playing in Mega Man's favor, unless in a doublesoul, he gains an anxious expression and following this, Darkchips begin to display themselves in the Custom Screen. Also during this emotional state, DoubleSoul transformations are disabled.  The player can return to a normal, calm state by successfully counter-attacking a virus, restoring HP, scoring hits on the enemy, or winning the battle.
If, during battle, Mega Man suffers repeated hits at a rapid rate, or if he is stunned for a period of time, he goes into a state of rage which is similar to Full Synchro in the way that it doubles Battlechip attack power, but instead of a focused expression in the emotion window, Mega Man has an angry expression and in the battle screen he glows orange. As such, it can be considered a desperation state which gives the player a chance to turn the battle towards their favor. Rage will expire when the player attacks and damages a virus, or if the player successfully counter-attacks, at which point the player will instead go into Full Synchro. It also expires after a while if no chip is used. Unlike Full Synchro, if Mega Man is hit while in rage, he will not revert to his normal emotion. During ""Full Synchro"" and ""Rage"" Mega Man's attacks double, giving him an extra advantage.
The Emotion Window is a feature that has lived on in the Battle Network 5 and 6 games. The basic functions of the Emotion Window stated above (Full Synchro, Anxiety, and Rage) have not changed since, though the anxiety emotion has been removed in Battle Network 6, replaced with Tired and Very Tired status.
""Battle Network 4"" brings out many new chips, with standard chips weighing in with 150 unique attacks. Mega Chips fell in number from the previous game, only having 60 different chips. Instead of V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5 chips (previously found in Battle Network 1 and 2 with V4 and V5 chips found only in 3) are now (Navi), (Navi)SP, (Navi)DS. Five version-exclusive Giga Chips appear in each version. There are 56 new kinds of chips, called, Secret Chips. Most of these are obtained by winning Higsby's ""Free Tournaments"", though there are a few exceptions.  For example, the player may obtain the ""Z-Saber"" chip by linking their game with a copy of Mega Man Zero 3. There are eight DarkChips in this game with bad effects to your Navi's soul and emotions. (See above section for information on DarkChips.)
In the previous two games, players earned different colored stars on the title screen for completing certain tasks. Battle Network 4 replaces these with badges (sometimes called icons or marks instead) on the top of the title screen, and continues these for the remainder of the series. Battle Network 4 includes seven icons, one for defeating the final boss Duo, one for getting all Soul Unisons, one for collecting all Standard-level battlechips, one for all Mega-level chips, one for all Giga-level chips, one for completing all Program Advances, and the last for defeating Bass (Forte in Japanese) in his Omega form.
Linking any edition of Mega Man Battle Network 4 with the Battle Chip Gate expansion for Game Boy Advance (Sold in Japan only) would allow you to play as a Navi, depending on what Navi chip you owned. Instead of selecting chips like in normal gameplay, the custom gauge at the top would fill up and change to four different colors as it filled up, white, yellow, and blue, and red. when the bar is yellow, you can use a regular chip. When it is blue, you can use a mega chip, and at red you can use a giga chip. shooting fills the gauge up faster.

Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Protoman|Rockman EXE 5 Team of BluesJP,,2005,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Gameplay in Mega Man Battle Network 5 in this game is largely similar to that of its predecessors. The player explores the real world through Lan and the Net through MegaMan.EXE. When Lan plugs his PET, a handheld computer, into a computer with an interface jack, he can upload MegaMan.EXE to the cyber network, allowing him to explore and fight viruses as random encounters.
When MegaMan.EXE encounters viruses, the screen shifts to a battle screen set on a six by three square grid. On the left half of the grid is MegaMan.EXE, and on the other half are his opponents. MegaMan.EXE has a relatively weak arm cannon, the Mega Buster, but his main weapon is Lan's library of battle chips, one-use-per-battle special attacks which grant various abilities, including simple attacks, attack enhancements, defensive effects, terrain transmogrification, or assistance from other NetNavis. Before battle, the player can construct a folder consisted of thirty battle chips, and each turn of a battle (measured by a timer bar at the top of the screen), the player is presented with a random selection of these chips. The player can send MegaMan.EXE m up to five battle chips, after which the battle takes place in real time, with MegaMan.EXE, controlled by the player, attacking with his Mega Buster, dodging attacks, or activating battle chips from his queue.[1][2]
MegaMan.EXE joins a team led by either Lan's and MegaMan.EXE's rivals Chaud and ProtoMan.EXE or new characters Baryl and Colonel.EXE, and the members of this team assist MegaMan in various ways. MegaMan.EXE can take on the attributes of one of his teammates with a Soul Unison.[1] The team plays its largest role in Liberation missions, wherein MegaMan.EXE and the rest of his team enter a part of the Nebula-controlled Internet to free the area via a time-limited battle with a group of viruses.[1] Also new to Mega Man Battle Network 5 are ""Dark Chips"", which are more powerful Battle Chips. While they appeared randomly in Mega Man Battle Network 4 when MegaMan.EXE was badly damaged, they act more like normal battle chips in this game in that they can be added to the battle chip folder like any other chip. Using Dark Chips has a downside: MegaMan.EXE will no longer be able to achieve Soul Unison, and every time MegaMan.EXE uses a Dark Chip, he permanently loses one point from his maximum hit points (HP).[3] He can, however, use a Dark Chip for a Soul Unison; this is called a Chaos Unison, which resembles a normal Soul Unison with the main difference being that the Mega Buster is replaced with the effects of the Dark Chip he used for the Chaos Unison. While using this effect doesn't cause HP loss, it has to be done with careful timing, as charging with poor timing will end the Chaos Unison and cause an invincible, evil version of MegaMan.EXE to join the viruses and attack him for a short period of time using random battle chips. Much like previous games in the series, Game Boy Advance copies of Mega Man Battle Network 5 can connect using the Game Boy Advance link cable to battle head-to-head or to trade battle chips.[1]

Mega Man Battle Network 6: Cybeast Falzar|Rockman EXE 6 DennÅjÅ« FalzerJP,,2005,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"There are many changes in gameplay in Battle Network 6. One of which is the chip-limiting system. It limits how many of the same chips the player can keep in a folder depending on its MB. Another one is a slight change in the Navi Customizer. Parts can be placed off the map, allowing the player to install more programs, but at the risk of having a bug.[5]
There are Link Navis can be controlled by the player, and have their own special chip, like MegaMan's allies in BN5.[5] However, these Navis can go about the net freely like MegaMan, although their jack-in point is fixed. Link Navi Charged Shots and special chip damage can no longer upgrade themselves. Instead, they are buster-dependent, giving buster-improving chips some more use. Link Navis can also get rid of obstacles that obstruct MegaMan's path, allowing him to reap rewards like mystery data containing rare items, or allowing access to Net Navis with secret information. The Link Navis include HeatMan.EXE in the Gregar version, and AquaMan.EXE in the Falzar version. The main drawback to playing as another Navi however, is that they cannot use the Navi Customizer.
Another new introduction is the Tag Chip System, which allows players to ""tag"" 2 chips together as long as the combined MB of the chips is 60 or lower. These chips will appear side by side in the Custom Screen when either one of them is drawn.[6] This system has allowed players to access low-MB chip combos or Program Advances with ease. Chips chosen as tag chips cannot be set as regular chips.
Succeeding the Soul Unison system, the Cross System is introduced in Battle Network 6. Although similar to the preceding system in Battle Network 4 and 5, Crosses can last for the entire duration of a battle without utilizing the three-turn limit and can be activated without a sacrificial chip. Upon finishing an ally Navi's mission and battle, MegaMan will gain the Navi Link to that particular Navi, thus enabling a Cross between MegaMan and the corresponding Navi.[5] There are 5 Crosses per game, and each has an element with attributes to the linking Navi. However, if MegaMan is hit by an element that he is weak against, he will instantly take double damage and revert to his normal state. While in a Cross, MegaMan cannot achieve Full Synchro.
Beast Out is an additional gameplay element after MegaMan encounters one of two Cybeasts. This feature can be activated by pressing the ""Beast Button"" in the Custom Screen. The Beast Button is equivalent to selecting a chip. Like Soul Unison, Beast Out lasts three consecutive turns and ""Emotion Points"" can be recovered by avoiding usage of the power in later battles. Upon expiration, MegaMan will be in an exhausted state but can still activate Crosses. However, as a consequence, he cannot achieve Full Synchro. You cannot beast out or beast over when you use the cross system or use five chips in one turn.
Beast Out also grants all neutral-element chips an additional 30 damage bonus. They can also be charged to launch a special attack against the nearest enemy. This attack is dependent on the form MegaMan has (i.e. the basic Gregar form is a slash where the Heat Beast is a flamethrower). Regardless of the cross, non-elemental (including sword, wind, etc.) chips are the only chips which can be charged. All chips, except those with no attack value or chips that cause the screen to dim, gain what has been called ""Auto Target"", where MegaMan attacks enemies at a very close range. He will move from his current location to the front of the targeted virus (the closest enemy) regardless of his location, and will initiate his attack. This effect lasts in all Beast Crosses, and will be removed when MegaMan becomes tired. Despite the similarities between the two Beast Outs, the two variations possess unique abilities and different buster attacks.
In the Japanese version, Beast Out can also be activated by using a Beast Link Gate (a Japanese GBA accessory).
When MegaMan's emotion points reach zero and the player Beasts Out, MegaMan will perform a desperation move called ""Beast Over"". He is placed into a berserked state but gains invincibility and uses chips automatically (similar to DarkInvis in the previous game).[5] Once the Custom Gauge fills, Beast Over automatically ends. Upon expiration, MegaMan's Buster stats drop to one and his HP rapidly drains. He is also unable to utilize any remaining Crosses nor achieve Full Synchro.
A new element, called ""Cross Beast"", occurs when MegaMan activates Beast Out while in a Cross or vice versa. In this state, the Cross will take the appearance and abilities of the corresponding Beast Out, as well as the attributes of the activated Cross.[5]
Cross Beast, much like a standard Beast Out, will deduct emotion points from MegaMan. It will also leave him exhausted, but will still allow him to activate other Crosses.
Dark Chips have all but vanished, almost all of them having been destroyed in the ending of Battle Network 5. This means the previously ""dark"" chips returning in this game can be used with normal Megaman. However, owners of the Japanese version can still use Dark Chips via the Beast Link Gate accessory, and without the previous penalty of losing 1 Hit Point from their maximum Hit Points. In addition to this, you can link up to a player playing the opposite version of the game you have and compare megachip libraries. the opposite version navi megachips will appear as secret chips and upon obtaining all of the opposite version navi chips you will be awarded with the starred ""s"" icon on the title screen (note that this isn't necessary to fight your versions sp beast or affect game progress).

Mega Man Battle Network 6: Cybeast Gregar|Rockman EXE 6 DennÅjÅ« GlagaJP,,20052006,,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"There are many changes in gameplay in Battle Network 6. One of which is the chip-limiting system. It limits how many of the same chips the player can keep in a folder depending on its MB. Another one is a slight change in the Navi Customizer. Parts can be placed off the map, allowing the player to install more programs, but at the risk of having a bug.[5]
There are Link Navis can be controlled by the player, and have their own special chip, like MegaMan's allies in BN5.[5] However, these Navis can go about the net freely like MegaMan, although their jack-in point is fixed. Link Navi Charged Shots and special chip damage can no longer upgrade themselves. Instead, they are buster-dependent, giving buster-improving chips some more use. Link Navis can also get rid of obstacles that obstruct MegaMan's path, allowing him to reap rewards like mystery data containing rare items, or allowing access to Net Navis with secret information. The Link Navis include HeatMan.EXE in the Gregar version, and AquaMan.EXE in the Falzar version. The main drawback to playing as another Navi however, is that they cannot use the Navi Customizer.
Another new introduction is the Tag Chip System, which allows players to ""tag"" 2 chips together as long as the combined MB of the chips is 60 or lower. These chips will appear side by side in the Custom Screen when either one of them is drawn.[6] This system has allowed players to access low-MB chip combos or Program Advances with ease. Chips chosen as tag chips cannot be set as regular chips.

Mega Man Zero|Rockman ZeroJP,,2002,Inti Creates,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","Roughly 100 years following the events of the Mega Man X series and the end of the Maverick Wars, the heroic Maverick Hunters X and Zero have long since vanished.[5] A human scientist named Ciel, her Cyber-elf Passy, and other Reploid companions are being chased through an abandoned underground laboratory. Their relentless pursuers are mass-produced androids called Pantheons, among other terrible machines. After taking heavy losses, Ciel, Passy and the remaining troops arrive at a sealed chamber containing Zero, who has been in stasis for a century.[6][7] Passy sacrifices itself to awaken Zero, who is amnesic. Ciel, desperately seeking his help, explains they live in a world where Reploids are incorrectly accused of being Mavericks and systematically ""retired"", apparently under the direction of the once-famed Mega Man X.[8] Shocked at this revelation and filled with doubt about his own identity as the Maverick Hunter of legend, Zero helps Ciel escape and joins her Resistance to fight against X and the utopia known as Neo Arcadia.[9]
Zero conducts missions on behalf of the Resistance in order to buy Ciel time to create a new energy source that will provide everyone with a safe place to live. One day, the base is attacked by Neo Arcadia, forcing everyone to flee. In the midst of the chaos, Ciel confesses to Zero that she helped create Neo Arcadia as a utopia where humans and Reploids were finally able to live in peace with X as their leader, but her plans fell apart when an energy shortage crisis began and X mysteriously disappeared. To counter this, while at age six, she created a ""copy"" of X to be its new leader.[10] Copy X strived for X's ultimate desire for a peaceful world, but lacked the original's moral judgement.[9] Believing that the Reploid race posed a danger to humans, Copy X began an operation to brand any Reploid whom he believed to be a menace to humanity as a Maverick and annihilate them without a fair trial, in order to reduce energy consumption.[11]
Zero invades Neo Arcadia and battles his way through the Four Guardians: Sage Harpuia, Hidden Phantom, Fighting Fefnir and Fairy Leviathan. Phantom self-destructs in a last ditch effort to destroy Zero, but fails, while the other three manage to escape. Copy X is eventually defeated, who also self-destructs in an attempt to take Zero with him. Zero escapes just in time from Neo Arcadia as Copy X, and everything around him, is destroyed. Running low on energy, Zero collapses in a nearby desert. A faint figure appears and reveals itself as the real X, now a Cyber-elf, who has been Zero's guide the entire time. X explains that he grew tired of fighting and, without a physical body, has left Zero the responsibility of bringing peace to the world.[12] As X vanishes, Zero finds himself surrounded by an army of Pantheons. Zero accepts X's words and promises to continue the fight against Neo Arcadia. The final scene shows Zero as he dashes into battle against the Pantheons and slices one in half.
","The narrative of Mega Man Zero is presented through text dialogue cutscenes with 2D sprites and hand-drawn, anime images.[6][13]
Mega Man Zero adopts the action-platforming gameplay prescribed by its predecessors in the original Mega Man and Mega Man X series. The player, as the protagonist Zero, is tasked with completing several side-scrolling stages, destroying enemies, completing objectives and battling bosses. The player can run, jump, fire the player character's primary weapon, or use a secondary weapon if it is available. As in the Mega Man X games, the player can dash along the ground, cling to and scale walls, or perform a combination of these abilities.[6][7] Unlike previous titles in the franchise where separate stages are selectable from a menu, Mega Man Zero is presented as a single, interconnected overworld. The Resistance base acts as a hub with almost every area in the game freely explorable from it. The player is given a choice of missions to undertake for each section of the map.[7] Completing one mission may unlock others. The player has only three lives to successfully complete a mission before receiving a game over. However, it is possible to fail non-critical missions by escaping the stage, using up both continues, or giving up the mission after dying. Doing so marks the mission as a failure, making it unavailable for the game's remainder.[6][13]
When available, each of the player's four weapons can be charged up for a more powerful attack. Moreover, the player can level-up weapons with prolonged use of them.[5] Depending on the weapon, leveling one up will allow for more attacks, increased attack range, or shortened charge time. In previous Mega Man games, the player would obtain new weapons from defeated bosses and could in turn use those weapons against other bosses and minor enemies. In Mega Man Zero, defeating some bosses earns the player elemental chips (thunder, fire, or ice) that can be used during a charged attack to further damage foes weak to a specific element.[14][15] Mega Man Zero also introduces ""Cyber Elves"", which can be found hidden in certain missions or dropped by enemies. Cyber Elves are collectible, single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game's levels.[6][7] Cyber Elf effects range widely, from reducing the life gauge of a boss to slowing down all enemies in a stage.[5][16] Up to three Cyber Elves can be equipped for a given level and some can only be activated once they are fed sufficient energy crystals picked up or collected from defeated enemies.[6][13][15] The player's performance is scored on a percentage scale and graded at the end of each mission. The results are based on parameters including the completion time, the number of enemies destroyed, and the player's total damage.[15]

Mega Man Zero 2|Rockman Zero 2JP,,2003,Inti Creates,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","One year has passed since Zero defeated Copy X. He has since separated from Ciel and the Resistance, now wandering the desert and defeating countless Pantheons. The three surviving members of the Four Guardians have assumed command of Neo Arcadia, with Harpuia as the leader. Copy X's death was covered up, as the humans revered him as their savior. The Resistance is now being led by a Reploid named Elpizo, while Ciel continues her work on a new form of energy that will hopefully eliminate the need for war.
Zero wearily makes his way through a sandstorm wrapped in a tattered cloak. As the sands die down he is once more being chased by enemies. Despite being in disrepair, with cracked armor and broken weapons, he charges into the fray. After the battle, Zero collapses from exhaustion and is found by Harpuia. Wishing to see Zero die in battle rather than perish from exhaustion, Harpuia rescues Zero and covertly delivers him to a location near the Resistance base, where he is found and repaired. He learns that Elpizo is planning a frontal assault on Neo Arcadia, as he doesn't believe in Ciel's plan of creating energy as means to resolve the war. Unable to convince him to call it off, Zero is left to do busy-work in the meantime.
Elpizo's assault fails miserably, himself being the only survivor. Driven mad, he declares his desire to harness the power of the legendary Dark Elf to destroy Neo Arcadia (and wipe out the humans), which had brought about the Elf Wars a century ago that left the Earth in a disastrous state. Using the powers granted by partially unsealing the Dark Elf, he invades Neo Arcadia and breaks into the temple where the body of the real X is kept. It is revealed that X ended the Elf Wars by sealing the Dark Elf away with his body, thus leading to his disappearance. Despite the Guardians' and Zero's best efforts, Elpizo  destroys X's body, which unseals the Dark Elf, and Elpizo absorbs its powers.
After a fierce battle, Zero puts an end to Elpizo's plans, who reverts to his normal self and apologizes as he dies. Surprisingly, the Dark Elf turns him into a Cyber-elf, convincing Elpizo that she is not truly evil. As the Dark Elf departs, X appears and tells Zero about the Dark Elf: she was originally known as the Mother Elf and was the savior who ended the Maverick Wars, but was later cursed by a man named Dr. Weil. Zero admits to feeling like he knows her.
In a post credits scene, an unknown man notes the Dark Elf has been released, and tells an entity known as ""Omega"" that it is time to take action.
","The controls are identical to that in the previous game, with players given the option to assign functions to the buttons they are most comfortable using. The weapons are also identical, with the exception of the Triple Rod, which has been replaced by the similar but somewhat more complex Chain Rod.
Cyber Elves are present in the game, and function in the same manner as they did in the previous game. However, unlike the first game, in which four specific Cyber Elves could be transformed into health-storing Sub-Tanks, two of the four Sub-Tanks are now hidden in various stages as collectible items, as they were in the previous series, while the remaining two must be unlocked using Cyber Elves.
While the first game in the series had the player select missions from a list, Mega Man Zero 2 returns to the traditional Stage Select option found in the Mega Man and Mega Man X games, although the player can only select from four at a time. In addition, whereas Mega Man Zero had a large, interconnected world, none of the stages in this game are linked.
New features added to the game are Forms and EX Skills. Forms are unlocked by completing various tasks during a mission, such as destroying a set number of enemies with the Buster Shot. Forms alter Zero's abilities in various ways, such as increasing the power of certain weapons or making him more resilient. However, they also tend to decrease performance in other areas, such as lowering attack power for increased defense or removing special attacks of the Z-Saber to enhance the Buster Shot. EX Skills are unlocked if a player completes a mission with an A or S rank, allowing the player to give Zero's weapons the properties of the bosses he's defeated.
Players begin the game with the Buster Shot and the Z-Saber. After the introductory mission, Zero is granted the Shield Boomerang and the Chain Rod, which replaces the Triple Rod in the previous game. As with the previous game, the player can unlock new attacks and abilities for the weapons through repeated use. There are fewer upgrades in this game; the Z-Saber has a total of four upgrades, while the rest only have two.
Cyber Elves function in the same manner as the previous game, being single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game's levels. They are hidden throughout the game as well as dropped by enemies. The use of Cyber Elves penalizes the mission score. There are three types of Cyber Elves, ""Nurse"", ""Animal and Hacker. While certain Elves can be used immediately, the larger Elves need to be fed crystals in order to be used. The cost for doing so is significantly less than it was in the previous game.
This game introduces the concept of Forms, which can be earned by meeting certain criteria throughout the game, ranging from killing twenty enemies in a stage with a dashing slash technique to getting twenty-five energy capsules in one stage.
Another new addition to the series is EX Skills, which are similar to Mega Man's ability to copy powers from the bosses in previous series. Unlike the previous series, however, Zero has to have an A or S rank going into the stage to unlock the bosses EX Skill. Unlike Mega Man's copy ability, which required weapon energy to feed the attacks, EX Skills modify Zero's weapons, adding new abilities or replacing their normal abilities with an ability similar to the defeated boss. For example, the Buster Shot can be modified to fire a long-piercing beam instead of its normal charged blast, while the Z-Saber gains additional moves such as a powerful rising slash.
As with the first game, a ""New Game Plus"" can be played by beating the game and loading the completed save file. In the new game, Zero will start with all activated Cyber Elves used from the previous game still in effect (the penalties, however, will still remain). Zero will also get to keep any EX Skills and alternate forms that he earned in the previous game. Additional modes can also be unlocked under proper conditions.
Hard Mode is unlocked by beating the game once. To play, hold L when selecting to start a New Game. In Hard Mode, Zero starts with the ""Proto Form"", which doubles his attack strength but halves his defense and locks his weapons at their basic level. Zero also cannot earn any EX skills or alternate forms. Beating Hard Mode will unlock a special ""Image Gallery"" option. Hold L and Select when selecting New Game to enter it.
Unlike the other games in the series, there is no Ultimate Mode to be unlocked. However, an ""Ultimate Form"" can be unlocked by leveling up and using every Cyber Elf in the game. It increases all of Zero's stats and also allows him to use full-charge attacks instantly by means of simplistic button combos.
If you have two cartridges and a link cable, the players can link two GBAs and take part in a two-player game. There are three modes available to take part in:[5]
"
Mega Man Zero 3|Rockman Zero 3JP,,2004,Inti Creates,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","Two months following Zero's victory over Elpizo, the Dark Elf remains at large. During this time, Ciel has finished her research on a new energy supply to end the crisis, dubbed the ""Ciel System"". While en route to Neo Arcadia to propose the Ciel System in hopes of ending the conflict and the genocide of Reploids, a spaceship with the Dark Elf's energy reading crashes to Earth.
Zero sets out to investigate, but instead finds the remaining Guardians (Harpuia, Fefnir, and Leviathan) fighting against a gigantic Reploid named Omega and a scientist named Dr. Weil â both who were banished to space due to their crimes in instigating the Elf Wars and turning the Mother Elf into the Dark Elf a century prior. Dr. Weil reveals he has resurrected Copy X, who resumes his rule over Neo Arcadia, much to Harpuia's chagrin. The Guardians, suspecting that Copy X is being heavily influenced by Dr. Weil, defect from Neo Arcadia. Zero and Dr. Weil go their separate ways in search of the Dark Elf.
The Dark Elf appears in a human residential district in Neo Arcadia, leading Dr. Weil and Copy X to launch a missile in order to incapacitate it. Although successful in capturing the Dark Elf, the incident kills thousands of humans. Following this event, Ciel rescinds her offer of the Ciel System, leading Dr. Weil and Copy X to brand the Resistance as Mavericks and subsequently launch an invasion against them. The Resistance is able to delay the invasion until Zero locates Copy X. During the ensuing battle, Copy X is betrayed and killed by Dr. Weil, who declares himself the new ruler of Neo Arcadia and announces his true intention for capturing the Dark Elf: to fuse it with Omega and link them with a frequency transmitter that would enable Omega to control the minds of every Reploid on Earth.
Zero confronts and defeats Omega, who reveals his true form: a body that looks exactly like Zero. Dr. Weil reveals that while Zero was powered down during his 100-year hibernation, he had transferred Zero's conscience and memories to a copy body and stole Zero's original body to be used by Omega due to its unmatched fighting abilities. Despite this revelation, Zero and the Guardians destroy his original body, killing Omega for good. Omega's death results in a massive explosion, which frees the Dark Elf from Dr. Weil's corruption, but kills Harpuia, Fefnir and Leviathan.
While Zero is unconscious, X appears and tells Zero that it's up to him to protect the Earth and defeat Dr. Weil. Finally out of power, X vanishes forever. The Dark Elf, known as the Mother Elf once more, delivers Zero to the Resistance Base before flying away.
","This game follows almost exactly the same rules as its predecessor, Mega Man Zero 2. Once again, Zero has his Z-Saber, Buster, and Shield Boomerang. However, Zero's rod weapon (originally the Triple Rod in Mega Man Zero and the Chain Rod in Mega Man Zero 2) has been replaced with the Recoil Rod: a pair of tonfa-like weapons that can be aimed in all directions. When charged up, a powerful stabbing attack is performed, which can knock enemies back, or propel Zero into the air if aimed down to the ground, like a makeshift pogo stick.
The Cyber Elf system has been given an overhaul with the introduction of Satellite Cyber Elves. These are different from the standard Cyber Elves, which have been renamed ""Fusion Elves"", in that they are equipped for a constant benefit, and the use of them will not affect the mission ranking score. However, only two Satellite Elves can be equipped at once.
Cyberspace is a new addition to the game. It is said by one Resistance Member (Hirondelle) that the portal to Cyberspace opened up due to Omega's arrival. Going through the door to Cyberspace leads the player into an area that looks exactly like the one in which they left but with a green tinge to it. Enemy appearances are less frequent and if a transfer of info from a Mega Man Battle Network 4/Mega Man Zero 3 link has been performed, certain virus enemies from the Battle Network Series will appear. All enemies drop health items (instead of other items, such as Secret Disks) in Cyberspace. Entering the Cyberspace causes certain Cyber Elves (both Fusion and Satellite, the ones with the A-mark on the lower left) to auto-activate without dying, even if not grown enough to be normally used, and these Elves do not affect the score. However, going into Cyberspace decreases the mission ranking score, making it more difficult to obtain an S or A Rank, which is needed in order to win EX Skills of the end-of-stage bosses. Zero no longer needs to ""level up"" in order to create weapon combos as they are already in place.
Throughout the game, enemies may drop Secret Disks, which may contain information about the Mega Man Zero series, enemy information, Cyber Elves, energy capsules, energy crystals or even customization chips.
Most of the disks can be opened by Zero himself, mostly those containing Cyber Elves, but the others are locked and the player will have to take them to Cerveau in order to open them. Once opened, their info will be stored in a Secret Disk library featured within the game.
The Forms system from Mega Man Zero 2 has been replaced with Customization Chips. These can be found in Secret Disks and come in three typesâhead, body and legs. Only one of each type of chip can be equipped at a time, which gives the player more flexibility in customizing Zero.
These Chips give direct upgrades to Zero's head, body or legs, and can be used to reproduce the effects of the various Forms that Zero could take in Mega Man Zero 2. As with the Forms in this game's predecessor, Zero can take on different colours when different body chips are equipped.
As with other Mega Man Zero games, beating the game will allow playing the completed save file again in a ""New Game+"". Zero will start with all Fusion Elves used from the previous game still in effect (although he will still be penalized for their use), and will also get to keep any EX Skills and body chips that he earned in the previous game.
Hard Mode can be unlocked after completing the game once. It can be accessed by pressing the L shoulder button before pressing Start while selecting a New Game. In Hard Mode, Cyber Elves cannot be used and Cyberspace cannot be accessed (save for one specific level). Zero's triple-slash and full-charge shot are also disabled, and he cannot earn EX Skills.
Ultimate mode can be unlocked by collecting all of the Secret Disks in one game and beating it. Hold R when starting a New Game to play. In Ultimate Mode, Zero starts with all Fusion Elves with permanent effects (such as the Elves that extend the life meter) already in use and without penalty in mission scores. Zero will also have a few body parts available from the start, including the Ultima Foot chip. Finally, Zero can use full-charge attacks instantly by means of simplistic button combos.
There are also seven mini games that can be selected from on the game's Start Menu. They are all unlocked after certain criteria have been met:
"
Mega Man Zero 4|Rockman Zero 4JP,,2005,Inti Creates,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP","Several months after the destruction of Omega, Dr. Weil has assumed a dictatorial reign over Neo Arcadia, forcing many humans to flee. In response, Dr. Weil labels the escapees as Mavericks and begins to purge them as if they were Reploids.
A fleeing caravan led by a human journalist, Neige, is attacked by Dr. Weil's army. Zero, Ciel and a small band of Resistance fighters happen upon them and come to their aid. Neige explains they were en route to Area Zero, the crash site of the space colony Eurasia and one of the last natural habitats on Earth that can support human life.[5] Shortly after parting ways, Zero learns of a plot called ""Operation Ragnarok"", meant to destroy all environments outside of Neo Arcadia in order to force humans to return and live under Dr. Weil's rule.[6] Helping Dr. Weil on his quest are a group of violent Reploids called the Eight Einherjar Warriors. They are led by a military Reploid named Craft, who has a romantic history with Neige, thus creating conflicting thoughts within him.
After defeating four of the Einherjar Warriors, Area Zero comes under attack by Neo Arcadia. Zero defends it and is forced to battle Craft. Neige breaks up the fight, but she is kidnapped by Craft, who escapes. Zero chases him to a prison where Neige is held and eventually rescues her.
Later, Zero eliminates the remaining Einherjar Warriors, but Ciel intercepts a radio message from Dr. Weil. He announces he is going to use Ragnarok, an orbiting satellite weapon, to wipe out Area Zero.[7]
Before Dr. Weil can use it, Craft turns on him and fires Ragnarok at Neo Arcadia in an attempt to kill Dr. Weil, which leaves the city in ruins. Zero, deeming Craft to be too dangerous, defeats him, and Craft succumbs to his wounds.[8][9]
Ragnarok moves on a crash course for Area Zero, and Zero makes his way there to find that Dr. Weil somehow survived the destruction of Neo Arcadia.  Dr. Weil reveals that while he is human, he was made into a bionic-reploid hybrid by the people who exiled Omega and himself into space at the end of the Elf Wars. His new body is incapable of aging or dying, as it constantly repairs itself.[10] Believing he can survive the impact of the crash and personally oversee the destruction of Area Zero, Dr. Weil fuses himself with the Ragnarok core and attacks Zero. After an intense battle and the destruction of Dr. Weil's body, Ragnarok breaks apart, but leaves Zero no means of escape.
Ciel runs through Area Zero where she learns that Zero did not teleport back.[11] 
Heartbroken and distraught, Ciel runs off and ends up on top of a hill, where she breaks down in tears while pieces of Ragnarok burn through the atmosphere. Afterwards, she stands up and expresses her faith in Zero, hoping that he'll return someday while promising to carry on his mission of maintaining peace between humans and Reploids. The final scene shows Zero's shattered helmet somewhere in the desert.[12]
","The fourth installment of the Mega Man Zero series introduces gameplay changes, but does not deviate from the platforming of its predecessors. Players guide Zero through eight main selectable stages, which are usually separated into two parts by a mini-boss battle. At the end of each level, the player faces one of the game's reploid antagonists.[13]
Mega Man Zero 4 includes a new Easy Mode, not found in its prequels, in response to criticisms that the Mega Man Zero series had become too challenging.[14][15] In Easy Mode, Zero receives a large life boost and can use the Cyber Elf without restrictions. However, Easy Mode prevents the changing of the weather, and consequentially the acquiring of EX Skills.[13][16]
Zero is still equipped with the Buster Shot and Z-Saber at default. However, in place of the Shield Boomerang and the rod-type weapon from the previous games (i.e.: Triple Rod, Chain Rod and Recoil Rod) is the new Z-Knuckle. This device allows Zero to perform several actions,[13] including hanging from pipes, destroying obstacles, stealing an enemy's weapon (if Zero destroys it using the Z-Knuckle) and acquiring special weapons in certain parts of a stage.
Another new element is the weather system, which allows players to choose between two weather conditions for each of the eight main stages. The difficulty of the stage varies depending on the chosen weather condition, with the stage being harder if the weather icon has an orange border around it. Sometimes, there are secret passages in some stages which the player can only reach by setting the weather to ""hard"". The trade-off for an easier level is that Zero cannot learn an EX Skill from a boss.[13]
Cyber Elves, a core element of previous Mega Man Zero installments, are small helpers who can assist Zero in combat. Shortly after the introductory levels, a Cyber Elf will arrive for Zero to equip. This elf has most of the powers of Cyber Elves from previous games, which are unlocked as the player raises its level by feeding it E-Crystals. Zero may select one power from each of three categories: Nurse, Animal, and Hacker.[13][15] The player's ranking at the end of a level is no longer given a penalty for using the Cyber Elves as long as they are kept under the maximum power limit. In addition to this, Zero can now equip body chips to enhance his abilities, including double-jumping and self-recovery, similar to early Mega Man X titles.[15]
Zero cannot rely on finding secret disks to give him enhancements as in Mega Man Zero 3. Instead, players must collect parts dropped randomly from defeated enemies. Recipes for combining these parts can be obtained from NPCs the player rescues or a Cyber Elf after its stages of evolution. However, the majority of the recipes are found through experimentation with combinations of parts.[17]
Another distinguishing feature of this installment is that Neige and Ciel have different faces depending on their emotion. For instance, after Zero ""dies"", Ciel is sitting near a tree and tells a promise that saddens her and brightens her. Neige also has an angry face, one that Ciel lacks.
Mega Man Zero 4 has multiple modes. Easy Mode and Normal Mode are available from the start.[18] Easy Mode makes the game easier to play, but prevents changing the weather conditions or acquiring EX Skills.

After completing the game once on Normal Mode, players can access an additional Hard Mode or start a new game over the old one.[19] There is also an Ultimate Mode, which can only be unlocked when certain criteria are met.[20] Like the previous game, there are seven mini-games that can be unlocked once certain criteria are met.[20] They are as follows:

Meine TierarztpraxisGER|Mijn DierenpraktijkNL,,2006,Independent Arts,DTP Entertainment,PAL,NaN,"Players assume the role of a veterinarian running a pet clinic and must heal sick pets back to full health. At the beginning of the game, this involves treating smaller pets such as guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, and birds. As the player gains experience, larger animals such as horses, dogs, or cats become available. The clinic's facilities can be expanded and altered (for instance, the style of kennels used to house the animals). Expanding facilities enables more pets to be housed and increases the range of treatments available. Players are also responsible for managing the clinic's finances and supplies.[1]
Each type of pet has a different type of task to be completed in order to heal them. Dogs can play fetch and be taken for a run to increase their fitness and horses can be ridden and taken out to the pasture. The Nintendo DS version utilizes voice recognition via the inbuilt microphone to issue commands to pets as well as to calm them during treatment.[1][2]
There are six available buildings to construct and expand: the practice, the therapy house, the small animal house, the cat house, the dog house, and the horse stalls. In town, there are nine stores to conduct business and train players' characters.
During the game, players can learn about different diseases and ailments. Ailments include fungus infection, Vitamin E Deficiency, ear inflammation, mold infection, Rabbit Flu, lung infection, corneal injury, liver infection, sunburn, asthma, and tonsil infections. As players move through the game, they are able to keep animals in animal houses for prolonged treatment. In the small animal house, they may keep guinea pigs, rabbits, or birds that have more serious injuries and diseases. When animals are in the animal houses, players must treat and feed them every day.
The game has a large playing world in which the character's actions are constrained by what time of day it is in-game. The clinic opens and closes at certain times of day, and if players wait too long to service a customer, they will leave the clinic. Patients must be healed in a certain amount of time, and customers will not pay their bill if players do not heal their animals.
In the game, players assume one of three characters: Hanna, Alex or Sophie. As one of these characters, players have many responsibilities to the clinic and the animals they are treating. They can dress the character for work, riding a horse, or for leisure. Players can also make them walk with the arrow keys or run while holding shift and using the arrow keys.
The game takes place in town, the animal practice, small animal house, cat house, therapy center, dog house, horse barn, fields and meadows, the forest, the beach, and town outskirts.  The  fields, meadows, practice, and town are the areas of the world that do not have to be purchased.  The small animal house, cat house, therapy center, dog house, and horse barn are things that players must purchase using the money they receive from treating patients. The forest, beach and town outskirts are areas players can eventually earn by completing objectives.

The player's task is to kill alien enemies who plan to take over the Earth. The player faces 12 different types of aliens across six levels in Manhattan, including sewers, rooftops, an airport, and the Men in Black headquarters. Some alien enemies pop out of the ground while others can fly or camouflage themselves to imitate objects such as bicycles or road signs. The player must also battle against boss enemies, including the leader of the invasion: an alien who is hiding out deep in the Men in Black headquarters.[4][3] A brief cartoon-style full motion video (FMV) appears at the end of each level.[10] The game includes three difficulty settings, and a password feature.[3]

Metal Max 2 Kai,,2003,,Now Production,JP,NaN,"Much of the gameplay is similar to its predecessor, Metal Max. The game is open-ended and non-linear, with the player given the freedom to decide where to go and what missions to do in whichever order. The player can choose the character classes, such as a mechanic or soldier, for the player characters. The battles are turn-based, with the characters able to fight either on foot or using tanks. The tanks can be created and customized by the player, who can modify and enhance each part of a vehicle, though there is a weight limit to each tank. In certain areas where tanks cannot pass, the characters must engage the enemies on foot. The game also features gambling machines where minigames can be played, including third-person shooter and racing games.[1]

Metal Slug Advance,No,2004,Noise Factory,SNK Playmore,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The gameplay is very similar to any other Metal Slug game, but with two new systems; the life system, and the card system. The life system is simply a life bar for players, as it replaces the extra lives from all the other Metal Slug games. As players take damage, the life bar depletes (different attacks cause different amounts of damage). Collecting food items can restore health, and players instantly die from being crushed, or falling down a pit.
The Card system is a card collecting part of the game. Cards can be found from shooting certain parts of the background, and by obtaining it from certain hostages, and sometimes by doing both. The cards have many different purposes, from giving detailed info on items and characters from the Metal Slug series to boosting player abilities, and even unlocking special (and new) slugs. There are 100 cards to collect, and collecting them all becomes the main objective to anyone who defeats the final boss.

Metroid Fusion,No,2002,Nintendo,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","Bounty hunter Samus Aran explores the surface of the planet SR388 with a survey crew from Biologic Space Laboratories (BSL). She is attacked by parasitic organisms known as X. On the BSL station, Samus loses consciousness and her ship crashes. The Galactic Federation recovers her body and discovers that the X has infected Samus' central nervous system. They cure her with a vaccine made from cells taken from the infant Metroid that Samus adopted on SR388.[9]:88 The vaccine gives her the ability to absorb the X nuclei for nourishment,[2]:8 but burdens her with the Metroids' vulnerability to cold.[10] Samus's infected Power Suit is sent to the BSL station for examination,[11] although parts of the suit were too integrated with her body to remove during surgery.[12]
When Samus recovers consciousness, she discovers that an explosion has occurred on the BSL station. She is sent to investigate.[13] The mission is overseen by her new gunship's computer, whom Samus nicknames ""Adam"" after her former commanding officer, Adam Malkovich.[2]:13 Samus learns that the X parasites can replicate their hosts' physical appearances,[14] and that the X have infected the station with the help of the ""SA-X"", an X parasite mimicking Samus at full power.[15]
Samus avoids the SA-X and explores the space station,[9]:98, 107 defeating larger creatures infected by the X to recover her abilities.[16] She discovers a restricted lab containing Metroids, and the SA-X sets off the labs' auto-destruct sequence. Samus escapes but the lab is destroyed.[9]:135â136 The computer berates Samus for ignoring orders, and admits that the Federation was secretly using the lab to breed Metroids. It also reveals that the SA-X has asexually reproduced, subsequently cloning itself. The computer advises Samus to leave the station.[17]
On her way to her ship, the computer orders Samus to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation, which plans to capture SA-X for military purposes.[18] Knowing that the X would only infect the arriving Federation troops and absorb their spacefaring knowledge to conquer the universe, Samus states her intention to destroy the station.[19] Although the computer initially intends to stop Samus, she calls it ""Adam"", and reveals that Adam died saving her life.[20] The computer suggests that she should alter the station's propulsion to intercept with SR388 and destroy the planet along with all X populations.[21] Samus realizes that the computer is the consciousness of Adam, uploaded after death.[22] En route to initiate the propulsion sequence, Samus confronts an SA-X, defeats it, and sets the BSL station on a collision course with SR388. As Samus prepares to leave, she is attacked by an Omega Metroid. The SA-X saves her; Samus absorbs its nucleus and uses her newly restored Ice Beam to destroy the Omega Metroid.[9]:141â143 Her ship arrives, piloted by creatures Samus rescued from the ship, and they escape before the station crashes into the planet, destroying it.[23]
","Metroid Fusion is an action-adventure game in which the player controls Samus Aran. Like previous games in the series, Fusion is set in a large open-ended world with elevators that connect regions, which each in turn contains rooms separated by doors. Samus opens most doors by shooting at them, while some only open after she reaches a certain point. The way the game unfolds is more linear than other Metroid games due to its focus on storyline; for example, Fusion introduces Navigation Rooms, which tell the player where to go.[2]
The gameplay involves solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, shooting enemies, and searching for power-ups that allow Samus to reach new areas. Samus can absorb X Parasites, which restore health, missiles, and bombs. Power-ups are obtained by downloading them in Data Rooms or absorbing a Core-X, which appears after defeating a boss.[2] The game includes features new to the franchise, such as the ability to grab ledges and climb ladders.[3]
The player can use the GameCube â Game Boy Advance link cable to connect to Fusion and unlock features in Prime:[4] after completing Prime, they can unlock Samus's Fusion Suit,[5] and after completing Fusion, they can unlock an emulated version of the first Metroid game.[6] In Metroid: Zero Mission (2004), players can connect to Fusion using the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable to unlock a Fusion picture gallery,[7] which includes its ending images.[8]

Metroid: Zero Mission,No,2004,Nintendo,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","Space Pirates attack a Galactic Federation-owned space research vessel and seize samples of Metroid creatures. Dangerous floating organisms, Metroids can latch on to any organism and drain its life energy to kill it. The Space Pirates plan to replicate Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then using them as biological weapons to destroy all living beings that oppose them. While searching for the stolen Metroids, the Galactic Federation locates the Space Pirates' base of operations on the planet Zebes. The Federation assaults the planet, but the Pirates resist, forcing the Federation to retreat. As a last resort, the Federation decides to send a lone bounty hunter to penetrate the Pirates' base and destroy Mother Brain, the mechanical life-form that controls the Space Pirates' fortress and its defenses. Considered the greatest of all bounty hunters, Samus Aran is chosen for the mission.[1]
Samus lands on the surface of Zebes and explores the planet, traveling through the planet's caverns.[1] She eventually comes across Kraid, an ally of the Space Pirates, and Ridley, the Space Pirates' commander, and defeats them both. Along the way, Samus finds and destroys Mother Brain. However, while Samus leaves the planet in her gunship, it is attacked by Space Pirates, causing it to crash back onto Zebes, near the Space Pirate Mothership.[4] With both her Gunship and Power Suit destroyed, Samus infiltrates the Mothership, eventually leading her to Chozodia, where a Chozo Statue offers her a trial. Upon passing the trial, Samus is rewarded with a new fully-upgraded Power Suit. Continuing to explore the Mothership, Samus eventually reaches the Ridley Robot,[5] a robot built in the likeness of Ridley. After defeating it, Samus escapes the planet using one of the Space Pirate's shuttles, while the Mothership self-destructs.[4]
","Metroid: Zero Mission takes place on Planet Zebes, a large, open-ended world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus Aran as she travels through the planet's caverns and environments, hunting Space Pirates. Along the way, the player collects power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities. These abilities allow Samus to access areas that were previously inaccessible,[1] so that the game can be played linearly or non-linearly. For example, the player may come across caverns that bypass certain sections, a method termed sequence breaking. To save their progress, players can enter either Save Rooms or Samus's ship on Crateria. As a remake of Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission's layout bears a resemblance to the original, and various powerups and items make reappearances from previous games in the series, with similar uses, effects, and appearances.[1] However, the game adds new items, areas, and mini-bosses,[2] as well as a completely new area named Chozodia.[1]
Zero Mission is the first game in the Metroid series to include a sequence in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In this portion of the game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, must crawl through ducts on her hands and knees without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.[3]
Completion of the game unlocks an emulated version of the original Metroid game.  Zero Mission also allows players to unlock the Metroid Fusion picture gallery by linking between Zero Mission and Fusion cartridges via the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.[1]

Along with Turbo Esprit and Midtown Madness, the game pioneered the use of an open world environment design instead of predefined circuit tracks. Both cities are designed for the street racing scenario.
Each city contains landmarks from their respective real life counterparts. Some of London's visible landmarks include Trafalgar Square, the Palace of Westminster and its Big Ben, and the Tower Bridge. New York includes such landmarks as Times Square, the Empire State Building, the World Trade Center,[1] Rockefeller Center, United Nations Plaza, Plaza Hotel, Madison Square Garden, Washington Square Park, the Wall Street Bull, Battery Park and Central Park.

Millipede / Super Breakout / Lunar Lander,,2005,Gravity-I,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The player no longer takes the role of the ""Bug Blaster"" from Centipede, but instead takes the role of an elf called the ""Archer"". The object of the game is to destroy a millipede that advances downward from the top of the screen. The millipede travels horizontally until it either hits an obstacle or reaches the edge of the screen, after which it drops one row and reverses direction. Once it enters the player's gray maneuvering area, it stays there and extra heads appear at intervals until both they and the millipede are destroyed. Shooting a body segment splits the millipede in two, with the rear portion sprouting its own head. A collision with any enemy costs the player one life.
All flowers and poisoned or partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms and score points during the process when the player loses a life.
At regular intervals, the player enters a bonus level with a swarm of enemies (bees, dragonflies, etc.) instead of the usual millipede. Each enemy awards increasing points, up to a maximum of 1,000 points per enemy. The attack ends when either the entire swarm has passed or the player loses a life. Also, at intervals new mushrooms will grow on the field while others disappear, in a pattern similar to Conway's Game of Life.
Players can whether to play at an advanced level, starting with a score that is a multiple of the number of points needed to earn an extra life (by default, 15,000). The gameplay is generally much more advanced than it would be had the player started with a score of 0 and worked their way up to that point level. The maximum advanced level allowed is a function of the preceding player's score, and games started at an advanced level where the player did not earn at least one extra life are not eligible for the high scoreboard.

Minority Report: Everybody Runs,,2002,Torus Games,Activision,"NA, PAL","The game starts with PreCrime Captain John Anderton pursuing future murderer Andre Serena throughout a meat packing facility. Anderton bests Andre in hand-to-hand combat and fellow PreCrime officer Barry arrives to subject the latter to virtual reality (a form of punishment since murder is outlawed in the society).
Anderton arrives at PreCrime HQ in Washington, DC where he is greeted by FBI agents Danny Witwer, Ben Mosely, and Ken Nara. Witwer explains that he was sent by the Attorney General to overlook the operations of PreCrime, since the Attorney General is concerned about PreCrime going national without checking for potential flaws. But before they go further, Barry interrupts Anderton to check out the vision made by the Precogs: John Anderton will be murdered by Nikki Jameson, a consultant of SOL Enterprises. Anderton, Barry, and Mosely arrive at SOL to apprehend her, but she manages to escape. Coming back to HQ, Anderton is haunted when the Precogs generated a new vision, revealing that John Anderton will murder Roy Verhagen, a man he had never met. Barry witnesses the vision and warns John to stay at home and lay low until they can look deeper into this revelation. As Anderton fights his way to escape PreCrime HQ, he confronts Mosely. Despite having PreCrime officers helping him, Mosely was soundly defeated by Anderton. Anderton makes his escape via jetpack. As the PreCrime is on the hunt, he takes the subway to lose them.
Anderton goes to the mall to find Rufus, a former criminal that runs a club inside. After a short talk, Anderton takes the back way out and heads back to his apartment. Once there, Barry informs him that the whole city has a bounty on him. He also tells Anderton that 2 out of the 3 Precogs have a report, with the last one's report is MIA, suspecting that there is a glitch in the program. Anderton tells Barry to send him info on Iris Hinemen, a woman who initiated the Precogs program. As he attempts to leave the apartment, PreCrime officers arrive to arrest Anderton. They are unsuccessful, as he manages to evade capture. Anderton makes his way to the rooftops, where Witwer surprises him. Anderton destroys the hovership Witwer is commandeering, seemingly killing him in the process.
As this was going on, Verhagen has a talk with Nikki, who is revealed to be a contractor hired by Verhagen himself to kill Anderton. Verhagen fears if Anderton were to be captured, Verhagen and Nikki's involvement would be brought into it. Later in the night, Anderton enters the sewers as a way to reach the botanical gardens, where Iris is located. After fending off the miniature spider robots, he arrives at the city gardens. He finds Iris in the greenhouse, where she tells Anderton that he has fell upon a scenario known as a ""minority report"": The Precogs are never wrong with their visions, but from time to time, they disagree on the outcome; the perpetrator could have an alternate future where he/she could be innocent and never committed the crime. However, this is a kept secret from PreCrime and the alleged perpetrator for their safety and it's erased from the system, Iris explains. Both Anderton and Iris agree that if the country knew about the minority report, the PreCrime task force will shut down. Iris tells him there's still time, as Anderton will have to find the minority in the Precogs and download the information needed to clear his name. As the conversation nears to a close, PreCrime arrives, and Anderton has to protect Iris from the task force and leave the gardens. As Iris finds a safe place, Anderton steals a jetpack and makes his way back to the sewers. Crawling with PreCrime, he slides through their presence and leaves the sewers.
Anderton meets up with a black market doctor at the Pepper Hotel for his eyes to be changed to stay clear of the city's optical scanners. However, there is commotion outside, as the thugs attempt to force PreCrime out of the slums. Other PreCrime officers enter the hotel to perform retinal scans. A temporarily blinded Anderton attempts to rest in the bath tub, but the spider robots send off a shock of electricity in the water, waking him up. Anderton leaves the hotel to witness a riot between PreCrime and the thugs. He manages to avoid the riots, only to run in with FBI agent Nara. After a brief shootout, Anderton incapacitates Nara and heads to the subways. He contacts Barry to get more information on Roy Verhagen.
Anderton arrives at PreCrime HQ to find Barry. Acquiring a stimulant and portable PreCog gear, he finds Barry, who reveals Verhagen as the one who runs SOL Enterprises, a multimillion-dollar company specializing in robotics, but behind closed doors, they work as a major deal in the black market, supplying criminal empires with weapons. Anderton frees Agatha from the compartment and make their way out of PreCrime HQ.
At the mall, Anderton takes Agatha to Clancy, a janitor, while he deals with security. As he completes this, Anderton and Agatha go to Rufus, where the former has to fend off PreCrime officers while Rufus tries to decode Agatha's visions. Once they're dealt with, Rufus warns Anderton to not mess with SOL Enterprises, but not before he tells him about Shinya Okawa, a former employee that left SOL because of their dangerous operations. Agatha returns to PreCrime as Anderton goes off to meet with Okawa.
On the subway train, during a routine retina scan, a PreCrime officer notices Anderton and alerts the other officers. With help from some civilians that fought back against PreCrime, Anderton makes his way to the front of the subway train car and commandeers it to stop at the next stop. As he walks out, he sees Mosely is waiting for him. Mosely suggests fighting with no weapons involved, and Anderton complies to it. The lengthy fight intensifies when Mosely calls for backup, but they were repelled by Anderton. Anderton defeats Mosely for the second and final time. Witwer, alive and well, comes and tells Anderton to turn himself in, but Anderton refuses, and takes the next subway train to leave Witwer attending to an unconscious Mosely.
Entering the ruins of the Sprawl, Anderton sees the riots are still going on. He finds Okawa inside his fortune cookie factory, where they have a brief heated discussion. As things simmer down, Anderton is sent to go to Okawa's apartment to retrieve the latter's computer in exchange for Okawa telling Anderton about Verhagen. Anderton retrieves the object, and Okawa reveals Verhagen's location. Anderton goes out to end the matter once and for all.
Anderton goes to a waste management facility, where it has a backdoor to the robotics facility Verhagen is hidden in. Once inside the robotics division, he fights off PreCrime and robots commissioned to kill Anderton. As Anderton taunts Verhagen, Nikki reveals herself to Anderton, and the two fight. Anderton gets the upper hand, forcing Nikki to retreat to the upper levels, where the fight resumes. Despite the second wind, NikkI is beaten and Anderton throws her down into the lower level. Verhagen fears Nikki dead and runs off. As Anderton prepares to pursue Verhagen, Witwer and two PreCrime officers arrive to apprehend Anderton. Nikki, having regained consciousness, gets up and attempts to kill Anderton with her gun, but Witwer intervenes and uses a Concussion gun to knock her unconscious. Anderton takes Nikki's gun and heads off to Verhagen. Desperately, Verhagen attempts to escape, but Anderton grabs the elevator door and points the gun at Verhagen. Verhagen begs for mercy, saying he can give Anderton money, women, or even power, but Anderton denies all of them. A gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black. As it cuts back, Verhagen sees that Anderton deliberately missed the shot, seeing that he will be imprisoned instead of being murdered.
Anderton witnesses Verhagen's imprisonment firsthand. Content with the results, Anderton is reinstated into PreCrime and leaves off via a hovership, ending the game.
","Minority Report: Everybody Runs is a third-person shooter beat 'em up game that spans 40 levels. Its main selling point is the ragdoll physics engine, with highly exaggerated effects to enhance interaction with the environment. Enemies thrown against walls or railings will strike or fold over them in a semi-realistic fashion, and will often smash through breakable objects. The player can also use futuristic weapons, both those featured in the movie and new ones created especially for the game by Activision. There are also a few levels which incorporate the use of a jetpack, allowing Anderton to fly around the environment.
A major aspect connecting the video game to the movie is that, in the film, protagonist Anderton believes that he has been framed for a future murder and sets out to prove his innocence. In line with the film as well, Anderton never uses lethal force against criminals or the cops that chase him, all weapons either render the opposition unconscious or incapacitated. However, the game does not use the likenesses of the actors from the movie, with the player character being voiced by Clancy Brown as well as looking like him.

Ethan arrives at the Yugarian Ministry of Information, and despite a few missteps from a new member of the IMF team, Jasmine Curry, the mission runs smoothly and Ethan makes contact with Marcou. Marcou, however, tells him when he is safely in England, the disk will belong to IMF. The plan goes south, as Marcou is shot and killed by Vasyl Berkut, the head of the Yugarian Secret Service. Ethan takes possession of the disk and pursues Berkut. Berkut escapes, then Luther Stickell and Billy Baird extract Ethan at the last minute to evade capture.
Making his way to Los Muertos Laboratories, Ethan disguises himself as a security guard to gain access to the lower levels of the facility, though it was short lived. He enters the computer core and is forced to hide when Jong Ho Li, a contractor and ally to Algo, and Sofia Ivanescu, a software engineer, come to download software onto the core. Once they leave, Ethan hacks the core and Luther reveals Los Muertos' plan to use three strains of neurodioxin. He requests Ethan and new IMF agent George Spelvin (disguising himself as a scientist) abort the mission, but Ethan refuses and destroys the biological weapons. But this sets off an alarm, causing Jong Ho to accuse Sofia of being a spy. He places bombs throughout the facility to cover his tracks, but Ethan disarms them. Outside, Sofia sabotages a helicopter, leaving Jong Ho and his men to Ethan's disposal. In a shootout, Ethan kills Jong Ho and follows Sofia to Yugaria.
Sneaking back in Yugaria's Ministry of Information, Ethan learns of ICEWORM, a deadly computer virus capable of breaking through any type of security system. Unable to access ICEWORM's codes, Berkut orders his men to apprehend Sofia to obtain the codes, inadvertently revealing to an overhearing Ethan that Sofia's father, Nicholas Ivanescu (long thought dead) is still alive, but in league with Algo. Using the electronic wasp and a sniper pistol, Ethan protects Sofia from Berkut's men, but as he tries to explain himself to her, she mistakes him for being Berkut's loyal and runs off. Almost falling to her death, and Ethan saves her. Ethan vows to protect Sofia and she accepts.
Ethan, Sofia, Jasmine, and Spelvin travel to Sansara (a notorious prison off the North African coast) to destroy the remains of the biological weapons that were transported from Los Muertos. Jasmine and Spelvin meet with Berkut and enter the ""Rat Trap"", with Ethan following the three. Meanwhile, Sofia talks with Algo about the use of ICEWORM, with Sofia revealing that using the virus is a means to avenge her father's apparent death at the hands of Yugaria's previous corrupt government. Ethan finds Algo's chief bioscientist in solitary confinement, who is revealed to be Nicholas. He agrees to help Ethan destroy the neurodioxin, and the latter takes Sofia to the data center so she can help him advance to the lab. Knocking out Berkut with the wasp, Ethan impersonates him and disables the neurodioxin. Meeting with Nicholas, Ethan witnesses Algo kill Spelvin, injure Jasmine, and take Sofia hostage through his microcamera. He plants explosives in the lab, and tells Nicholas to escape. Ethan covers Jasmine as she makes her escape. Unable to find Sofia nor Algo, Ethan escapes thanks to Billy coming back for Ethan.
Learning that Algo is using a plane as a mobile headquarters, Ethan skydives and activates a jetpack to get onto the plane. On board, Algo betrays and kills Berkut by using an experimental rocket launcher. Ethan plants explosives on each wing of the plane. Ethan finds Sofia in the cabin, but Algo surprises him. As he prepares to kill her, Sofia kicks him out of the plane, but not before he grabs her and she falls. Ethan pursues the two, grabbing a parachute from one of Algo's men. He rescues Sofia, and sees Algo landed in the SURMA Building, a company he runs as a front for his terrorist activities.
Ethan and Sofia land on the SURMA Building, where Algo meets them. As Sofia runs away to safety, Ethan hunts down Algo throughout the rooftop. The two meet for a final confrontation, where Algo uses an experimental invisibility device to his advantage. Despite this, Ethan disrupts the technology and kills Algo.
Weeks after the incident, Ethan and Sofia are on a private cruise near Aruba. As Sofia says her dealings with technology are over, she and Ethan kiss, then go scuba diving.

Monster House,,2006,Artificial Mind and Movement,THQ,"NA, PAL","At the beginning, DJ, Chowder and Jenny are pulled into the home, in the police car. After that, they give a jump to avoid being eaten by the house while the police car is thrown down into the stomach.
However, Chowder and Jenny are pulled away from DJ shortly after, by two giant pipes. DJ finds a key in a chest beneath the stairs and uses it to unlock the door to the kitchen. He sees a burning toaster and quickly puts out the fire. After stepping into the house's spotlight, he fights a living chair and enters a hallway where he sees some living chairs go into a nearby room. After finding a key to the bathroom at the end of the hallway, he fights floor crawlers along the way and a living TV passes from behind him after he walks through a door. He dodges some incoming flying books and goes through the bathroom that leads him back to the foyer where he fights another living chair. Meanwhile, Jenny finds herself in the attic and after jumping across a stack of crates that swift away, she tries to get back by going through the air vents, but she gets trapped by a blockade of pipes.
Chowder finds himself in the greenhouse and after exiting the greenhouse and finding a spare light bulb for his water gun, he fights living chairs and wall lamps before arriving in the kitchen and after defeating numerous floor crawlers, he is attacked by a giant pipe, he narrowly escapes the pipe by falling down a dumbwaiter shaft. DJ meanwhile, enters the family room where the phonograph in the room begins playing music and awakens flying books. He manages to fight them off until the phonograph stops playing, unblocking a door to a hallway that leads him to a room with a player piano in it. The piano suddenly begins to play by itself, awakening two living chairs, one normal and one red that is constantly revived by the piano's music. DJ disables the piano, which weakens the red chair and allows DJ to finish it off. He retrieves a key inside the piano and makes it back to the family room where he uses the key to unlock the door to the library. DJ then searches for a dusty book and uses it to open a secret passageway and enters an air duct that leads him to the basement where he finds a crashed police car (possibly the same one that got thrown down into the house's stomach). He contacts Skull and he tells DJ that in order to get out, they have to kill the house by taking out its heart, which is the furnace. DJ goes into the next room and when he tries to open a door, the knob falls off and lands on the ceiling. He turns on two washing machines to knock a large crate down from a shelf and while he moves it over to a wardrobe to climb up it to reach the doorknob, living chairs and gas tank monsters attack him. He is able to fight them off and retrieve the doorknob. DJ then comes across a door with a unseen fiery field behind it. He find a key inside a jar and uses it to unlock a crest and finds a hook inside it. He enters a large room where blockade of pipes prevent him from going any farther. After moving a crate to an open area of the blockade to block off a section of pipes, he was able to get inside the blocked area and moves another crate under a ladder and uses the hook to bring down the ladder and uses it to get to the second floor. Finding himself back in the foyer on the second floor, DJ tries to open an unblocked door that leads to a bedroom, which suddenly throws him inside and closes. He find a key in a jar and uses it to unlock a nearby door to a sideways bedroom where he finds the missing grate handle to the fireplace back in the other bedroom. He opens the fireplace and puts out the fire, revealing a secret passage that takes him to the attic. While avoiding the house's spotlight, he moves the same pile of crate that Jenny jumped across earlier back to the middle, uncovering an air duct. He moves another large crate under the vent so he can climb up to it. He goes through the vent which takes him to a hallway where he finds a key in a nearby room and uses it to open the door to another room at the end of the hallway and finds Jenny still stuck in the vents.
The room where he finds her turns 180Â° (upside down) as DJ goes forward and after defeating numerous monsters, He goes over to Jenny, but can't free her. Finding another way, Jenny enters the master bedroom and after hearing a telephone suddenly ring, it stops when she approaches it and while looking at some pictures, a floor crawler comes by, getting her attention as a TV comes to life. Jenny defeats the living TV and encounters the first boss in the next room, a large doll that resembles Constance, Nebbercracker's late wife, which comes to life when the chandelier above falls on it. She fights it by destroying the light bulbs on it and finishes it off by shooting the beam holding it up and grabbing the chandelier chain while open firing her water at it. Following her fight against the doll, she finds a way back to the attic.
In the attic, Jenny finds what appears to be a painting of her and a lamp suddenly comes to life. She defeats the lamp and finds a key in the next room and fights a living stove in another room and uses the key to unlock the door there. A blockade of pipes appear and she sees DJ on the floor below. DJ comes after her, but is eaten by a canopy bed in the master bedroom after defeating many monsters and finding a key on it. Up in the attic, Jenny find a train set powered by a bicycle. Monsters ambush her while she moves the model train, which eventually comes off the track and disappears into a poster, where she find a small tunnel behind it, leading into another room. After defeating two living stoves and three living lamps and after she recovers the missing gear to the dumbwaiter, she uses it to get to the basement.
Meanwhile, having woken up in the bowels of the house after falling down the dumbwaiter, Chowder fights a living TV and enters a flooded room. He climbs up to a platform where he moves a crate to a nearby pipe with a valve and turns it to drain out the water. Chowder then fights off many monsters consisting of gas tanks, floor crawlers, and lamps and encounters the second boss, a large killer pipe. After defeating them all, he moves another crate to a high up platform and finds a key to the nearby door behind some furnaces. After using it to unlock the door, he enters an underground bathroom where a TV passes from behind while he goes through a door. Making his way through the labyrinth, Chowder fights two more living TVs and encounters the third boss, again the giant pipe, but has to defeat it three times before he can make his way to the actual basement.
Having made her way to the basement, Jenny fights two living TVs and another living stove and reunites with DJ. Meanwhile, Chowder must make his way through a maze of toys in another part of the basement.
At the end of the maze, Chowder finds his lost basketball but also finds the fourth boss, this time, two large pipes instead of one. Chowder enters a circus-themed area where he plays shooting games to find the missing eye and nose of the clown on a merry-go-around to move forward (all while fighting off chairs, floor crawlers, gas tanks, and a TV, which will only come alive if Chowder fails at one of the games) and reunites with DJ and Jenny.
They discover that the house is possessed by Constance. They try to destroy the furnace (the heart of the house), but fail and are separated again by three giant pipes.
The children then fight to escape the house by making their way through the maze of corridors, encountering more enemies along the way. They all then reunite again in the main entrance and narrowly escape the house thanks to Jenny, who pulls down on the house's uvula (chandelier).
After escaping, the house chases them to an abandoned construction site, in which along the way, causes a manhole to pop out of the ground and throws a car at them. Chowder fights off the house, the final boss, with a backhoe.
Then DJ, while hanging from a construction crane, throws an active dynamite down the house`s chimney, destroying the furnace and the house itself. DJ then says one last monologue, then the game's credits roll.
","The game follows the plot of the film, except it introduces many rooms in the house that were unseen in the film. The three main characters D.J., Chowder and Jenny must navigate through the house to reunite with each other and destroy the house. The enemies in the house are living furniture that may also serve as bosses in some areas. Obstacles include pipes that can block doors or pathways to keep the player on track, tentacle-like pipes that can harm the player, trees that can try to grab the player, objects that can fly at the player, spotlights that can summon monsters to attack the player if they're caught, and giant pipes that can suck up the player. The game has about nine chapters that each tell the story from each of the characters' perspective. Bathrooms serve as save points throughout the game and are the safest parts of the house. Players can attack enemies and bosses using their water guns or by counterattacking. Each character also has a special ability that they can use to combat monsters: D.J. can stun enemies with his camera, Jenny can attack enemies and destroy padlocks with her slingshot and Chowder can attack enemies with water balloons. Boxes containing ammo for the secondary attacks can also be used for refill. Additionally, food found around the house can restore health and tokens allow the player to play the game ""Thou Art Dead"".

Mortal Kombat Advance,,2002,Virtucraft,Midway,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Two new gameplay modes have been introduced since the original Mortal Kombat 3: the 2-on-2 mode which was similar to an Endurance match but with as many as three human players in a given round on both sides (these had not been seen in the series since the first Mortal Kombat), and a new eight-player Tournament mode. An extra Master difficulty is present. Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures â selectable prizes, of which some are extra fights and others lead to various cutscenes or other things â are introduced after either the main game or the eight-player Tournament are completed.
To balance the gameplay, some characters were given new moves and some existing moves were altered. Some characters were given extra combos and some combos were made to cause less damage. Chain combos could be started by using a jump punch (vertical or angled) or a vertical jump kick, which creates more opportunities to use combos. Combos that knock opponents in the air no longer send one's opponent to the level above in multi-layered levels; only regular uppercuts do this.
The computer-controlled opponent AI was improved in the game. However, three new flaws were introduced along with the revisions: while backflipping away from an opponent, if the player performs a jump kick, the AI character will always throw a projectile; this leaves the computer character vulnerable to some attacks and can easily lead into a devastating combo. If the player walks back-and-forth within a certain range of the AI character, the opponent will mimic the player's walking movements for the whole round and never attack. If the computer opponent is cornered, the player can repeatedly perform punches without the AI character stumbling back, thus allowing the player to win easily.
UMK3 features several new backgrounds: Scorpion's Lair/Hell (this stage also contains a new Stage Fatality, where an uppercut can send the opponent into a river of lava); Jade's Desert (in a reference to his MK3 ending, Cyrax is seen stuck waist-deep in sand in the background); River Kombat/The Waterfront; Kahn's Kave/The Cavern; Blue Portal/Lost (a combination of the background from the UMK3 ""Choose Your Destiny"" screen, the Pit 3 bridge, and the mountains and bridge from the Pit II in Mortal Kombat II); Noob's Dorfen (based on the Balcony stage, which can now be played using a Kombat Kode without having to fight Noob Saibot to see it as in MK3). Before reaching any of the original MK3 backgrounds in 1- or 2-player mode, the game must cycle through all of the UMK3 exclusive backgrounds twice. Scorpion's Lair, Secret Cave and Abandoned River stages are selectable by using a password while on the missing Bank Stage cycle. In Scorpion's Lair, fighters can uppercut each other into Kahn's Kave. The original red portal background used for the ""Choose Your Destiny"" screen is now blue.
Some elements from MK3 are missing in UMK3. The only biographies featured are those of Kitana, Jade, Scorpion and Reptile (the ninja characters who were not included in MK3), which are the only four shown during attract mode, while all of the biographies and the full-body portraits of the MK3 characters are missing. The biographies that do appear in the game are presented differently from those in MK3, as are the endings. The storyline images and text do not appear. Finally, the Bank and Hidden Portal stages from MK3 were removed (Jade's Desert serves as a placeholder where The Bank stage used to appear once the player reaches the original MK3 level cycle).

Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance,,2002,Midway,Midway,"NA, PAL","At the end of Mortal Kombat 4 (which is Scorpion's canon ending), Quan Chi revealed himself to be the murderer of Scorpion's family and clan, before attempting to send him back to the Netherrealm. Scorpion, fueled with homicidal rage, grabbed Quan Chi at the last minute, taking the sorcerer with him. In the opening intro to Deadly Alliance, it is revealed that Quan Chi was able to escape the Netherrealm, using the amulet he had stolen from Shinnok. He appears in a tomb containing several mummified remains and an ancient runestone, which reveals that the remains are the ""undefeatable"" army of the long-forgotten ruler of Outworld, known simply as the ""Dragon King"". Learning that it can be revived, Quan Chi forms an alliance with Shang Tsung, offering him an endless supply of souls in return for him transplanting the souls of defeated warriors into the army. The two work together to defeat, and kill, Shao Kahn and Liu Kang, the two greatest threats to their plans. Unable to interfere as an Elder God, Raiden surrenders his status after realizing that, should the alliance be victorious, Earthrealm is doomed.
In Deadly Alliance, the player receives information concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another mainly during Konquest mode, but also by way of biographies that can be obtained in the Krypt. The game takes place in a science fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring in the fictional realms of the Mortal Kombat series. The story begins in the Netherealm (although this is not a playable level), and later switches to Outworld, Edenia and eventually Earthrealm. To fully understand the plot of Deadly Alliance, the player must not only complete the Konquest mode but the Arcade mode as well. As usual, completing the Arcade mode unlocks endings for each character, but only a few endings or parts of them are considered part of the continuity of the Mortal Kombat storyline. Some endings even contradict one another. What really happened to the characters was only revealed in the sequel Mortal Kombat: Deception, making Deadly Alliance the first game in the series to have an in-continuity ending that involves the heroes losing and the villains emerging victorious.
","Like all of the Mortal Kombat games, Deadly Alliance focuses heavily on its fighting modes. The gameplay is completely different from that of previous entries in the franchise. Each character now possesses three individual fighting styles,[1] generally two hand-to-hand styles and one weapon style (except for Blaze and Mokap, who received three hand-to-hand styles and no weapon style) which players can switch between with the push of a button. In previous games, aside from ""dial-a-combos"" all the characters fought virtually identically, with only special moves to differentiate them. The number of special moves per character (usable in any fighting style) has also been reduced, varying only from two to four for most, thus forcing the player to make use of the improved fighting system. The characters can no longer run, and there is no run meter. However, while still limited to only moving into the background and foreground, movement in the third dimension is much easier and can be used continuously (in Mortal Kombat 4, sidestepping was mapped to two different buttons and could be performed at a rate of about one second). To prevent fighters from leaving the arena, boundaries that are otherwise invisible appear when a fighter is knocked against the edge.
Characters models became more realistic. Flesh will move or jiggle on a character as he or she moves around. Environmental interaction is present, but infrequent. Several levels include obstaclesâsuch as pillars or statuesâthat can be shattered to damage an opponent standing near one. There is just one Fatality per character, while the previous games included many ways to finish the opponent. Along with Mortal Kombat X (until the XL patch added them to Mortal Kombat X), it is the only other Mortal Kombat game that does not include Stage Fatalities, although the Acid Bath level still possesses special acid-vomiting statues called Acid Buddhas that do damage directly to fighters that stray too close to them.
Deadly Alliance introduces the Konquest mode, which expands on the storyline and acts as a tutorial for each character. The Konquest mode consists of a series of missions to complete with each of the characters. In between each sequence, a video of a monk moving between various locations on the path of Konquest is shown, but this has no actual bearing on the gameplay itself other than to simulate the sense of a journey. After completing eight initial ""kombat tasks"" with Sub-Zero, the player is instructed to complete a specific set of tasks with each character, which vary from performing difficult combos to defeating opponents. Each series comes with text instructions that include a basic storyline that delves further into each character's background and motives. The characters Blaze and Mokap can only be unlocked by completing all stages of konquest. Upon completing each mission (of a starting difficulty for each character that increases per mission), the player is rewarded with a number of ""koins"" that act as the in-game currency to open koffins in the krypt and unlock secrets in the game.
The krypt is a feature in which the player can buy extras with koins earned in regular play and in konquest mode. The krypt consists of 676 ""koffins"" arranged in a square format with each designated alphabetically by a two-letter designation (AAâZZ). The koffins are filled with a vast number of secrets and unlockables. Each koffin has a different designated price, listed in a number (anywhere from 1 up to the thousands) and type (Gold, Ruby, Sapphire, Jade, Onyx, and Platinum) of koins that it would cost to open the koffin. The Krypt includes unlockable characters, arenas, and alternative costumes. Also included among the koffins are various videos, images, concept sketches, and the entire Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition comic book. Some koffins contained koins that could be used towards other koffins, others contained hints as to where other items were located, and others were even empty.
Test Your Might, the original minigame of the Mortal Kombat series, returns for the first time since the original game, and a variation, Test Your Sight, is also included. In Test Your Sight, the character stands in front of a set of cups, and the game shows the player which cup contains the Mortal Kombat logo icon. The cups then begin to move in a random order, and by the end one has to select the cup containing the icon. As the player progresses through the minigame, the number of cups increases, as does the speed at which the cups move. At higher levels, the camera would even move in order to make it more difficult for the player to keep track of the movement of the icon. Succeeding at both Test Your Might and Test Your Sight rewards the player with koins.
The Game Boy Advance-only Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition adds three modes: Survival, Tag Team and Practice, as well as weapon Fatalities. Although both of the GBA versions feature 2D sprites, Tournament Edition was the first portable Mortal Kombat games to feature 3D style gameplay.

The Konquest mode consists of a series of missions to complete with each of the characters. In between each sequence, a video of a monk moving between various locations on the path of Konquest is shown, but this has no actual bearing on the gameplay itself other than to simulate the sense of a journey. After completing eight initial ""kombat tasks"" with Sub-Zero, the player is instructed to complete a specific set of tasks with each character, which vary from performing difficult combos to defeating opponents. Each series comes with text instructions that include a basic storyline that delves further into each character's background and motives. The characters Blaze and Mokap can only be unlocked by completing all stages of konquest. Upon completing each mission (of a starting difficulty for each character that increases per mission), the player is rewarded with a number of ""koins"" that act as the in-game currency to open koffins in the krypt and unlock secrets in the game.
The krypt is a feature in which the player can buy extras with koins earned in regular play and in konquest mode. The krypt consists of 676 ""koffins"" arranged in a square format with each designated alphabetically by a two-letter designation (AAâZZ). The koffins are filled with a vast number of secrets and unlockables. Each koffin has a different designated price, listed in a number (anywhere from 1 up to the thousands) and type (Gold, Ruby, Sapphire, Jade, Onyx, and Platinum) of koins that it would cost to open the koffin. The Krypt includes unlockable characters, arenas, and alternative costumes. Also included among the koffins are various videos, images, concept sketches, and the entire Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition comic book. Some koffins contained koins that could be used towards other koffins, others contained hints as to where other items were located, and others were even empty.
Test Your Might, the original minigame of the Mortal Kombat series, returns for the first time since the original game, and a variation, Test Your Sight, is also included. In Test Your Sight, the character stands in front of a set of cups, and the game shows the player which cup contains the Mortal Kombat logo icon. The cups then begin to move in a random order, and by the end one has to select the cup containing the icon. As the player progresses through the minigame, the number of cups increases, as does the speed at which the cups move. At higher levels, the camera would even move in order to make it more difficult for the player to keep track of the movement of the icon. Succeeding at both Test Your Might and Test Your Sight rewards the player with koins.
The Game Boy Advance-only Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition adds three modes: Survival, Tag Team and Practice, as well as weapon Fatalities. Although both of the GBA versions feature 2D sprites, Tournament Edition was the first portable Mortal Kombat games to feature 3D style gameplay.

Mother 3,,2006,Brownie Brown / HAL Laboratory / Nintendo,Nintendo,JP,"Taking place in the fictional Nowhere Islands an unknown length of time after the events of Mother 2, Mother 3's story is told in eight chapters, including a short prologue.[5] The game begins with twins Lucas and Claus and their mother Hinawa visiting her father, who lives in the northern reaches of the Islands. During their stay, their residence, Tazmily Village, is invaded by mysterious forces known as the Pigmask Army. Hinawa's husband, Flint, is awoken by the Pigmasks' forest fire; upon learning his family has not returned, he searches for them, and discovers that Hinawa has been killed by the normally docile Dragos while protecting Lucas and Claus. As Hinawa is laid to rest, Claus disappears; Flint attempts to find him but is unable to.
In chapter two, neophyte thief Duster meets princess Kumatora while stealing a mystical egg from an abandoned castle. He and the egg go missing after falling into a trap. In chapter three, Tazmily Village, devastated after Hinawa's loss, is introduced to mysterious devices named Happy Boxes by a mysterious peddler, who uses a captured and tortured monkey named Salsa to lure potential buyers. Salsa escapes after his owner is attacked by Dragos led by Lucas.
In chapter four, three years have passed, and Tazmily Village has been modernized with railroad stations, businesses, and modern suburban residences. Lucas learns psychic powers from a superpowered, benevolent, androgynous creature known as a Magypsy, recovers the amnesic Duster from life as a bandmate, and recruits Kumatora hiding as a servant in a club. In chapter five, Lucas, Duster, and Kumatora recover the mystical egg said to hold the world's secrets and meet a mysterious Masked Man. In chapter six, Lucas sees visions of his mother in a field of sunflowers.
In chapter seven, Lucas and his dog, Boney, learn about the seven Needles kept by seven Magypsies that quell a sleeping dragon underneath the earth. A prophecy foretold that a ""chosen one"" would come to pull the Needles and wake the dragon and determine the fate of the world. Lucas and the Masked Man race to pull all seven needles. The final needle takes Lucas and his company to New Pork City in the eighth chapter, where Porky Minch, the secondary antagonist of Mother 2, is revealed to be the ruler of the Pigmask Army. In the Empire Pork Building, Lucas defeats Porky, who permanently seals himself in a device called the Absolutely Safe Capsule, rendering him unable to continue the battle. At the final needle, the Masked Man is revealed to be a brainwashed Claus, during the battle between Lucas and himself, his memory of his mother restores his humanity. He commits suicide due to the grief of his actions and his mother. Lucas pulls the final Needle, awakening the Dragon and destroying the Nowhere Islands. In an epilogue set in darkness, the game's cast reveals that they have survived.[6] In the final frame, the Mother 3 logo is shown to be made completely of wood instead of metal.[7]
","Mother 3 is a single-player role playing video game similar to previous games in the Mother series. The player controls a party of playable characters who explore the game's two-dimensional fictional world, primarily shown from a top-down perspective. While navigating the overworld, the player may converse with non-player characters, obtain items, or encounter enemies. Winning battles against enemies awards experience points to the party, which is required for leveling up. Leveling up a character permanently enhances its individual attributes such as maximum hit points (HP), power points (PP), offense, and defense. Weapons, armor, or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes. The player can restore their characters' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting hot springs which are abundant in the game world, and the player can save the game by talking to frogs.[1] Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points (DP), earned by winning battles and used to purchase items. The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs.[2]
Mother 3 retains the turn-based battle system featured in EarthBound. When the player comes into contact with an enemy in the overworld, the game transitions to a battle screen. Battles are viewed from a presumed first-person perspective, showing the enemies against a distorted, animated background. The player can assign each character in their party to perform an action, such as attacking an enemy or using items to restore HP or PP. Some characters can utilize psychic-based abilities referred to as PSI, which includes stronger attacks and healing abilities, and require PP to execute. Like EarthBound, combat uses a ""rolling health"" system: when one of the player's characters is injured, its HP will gradually ""roll"" down, similar to an odometer, rather than immediately decremented. This allows a mortally wounded character to perform actions like attacking or healing themselves, as long as the player acts quickly enough. If a character loses all HP, it will become unconscious and cannot participate unless revived by another character. The player loses a battle if all characters become unconscious; the player will then be given the option to continue play from the nearest save point, but with half the DP on their person.[3]
Combat in Mother 3 includes a unique musical combo system not seen in previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button in time with the beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row.[4] When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.[1]

Moto Racer Advance,,2002,Adeline Software International,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The player controls a motorcyclist and must try to win races on various terrain and settings. Each motorcycle in the game handles differently with some performing better on paved roads and others working better on rougher terrain.[1]
There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia.[2] The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners.[3] The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game.[2] Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of ""powersliding"" on corners.[3] The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles.[1] Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.[3]
There are three different methods of gameplay: Championship, Progression, and Single Race. The single race mode must be earned through playing the progression mode. Progression is the game's ""main mode"" and places the player in a number of different tournaments and races in all three racing styles. It allows the player to earn hidden content, including new bikes which handle differently.[3] The game contains link cable support for up to four players, provided that all four people own a copy of the game.[1]

Mouse Trap / Operation / Simon,,2005,Gravity-I,Destination Software,,NaN,"The basic premise of Mouse Trap has been consistent over time, but the turn-based gameplay has changed. Its concept was first invented by Marvin Glass and his company, Marvin Glass and Associates, who were later granted a US patent in 1967.[2] The original published version of the game in 1963 was then designed by Hank Kramer of Ideal Toy Company, filling in the details Glass had left open, and allows the players almost no decision-making, in keeping with other games for very young children such as Candyland or Chutes and Ladders (Snakes and Ladders). Players take turns rolling a die to advance their mouse piece along a path around the game board, from the start space to a continuous loop at the end. The Rube Goldberg-like mouse trap is assembled in the center of the board, with players adding one or more of its pieces when they land on specified ""build"" spaces. The trap is always assembled in a specified order, and is attached to the board by inserting tabs into holes and locking them into place.[3]
Along the ending loop are additional ""build"" spaces (in case the trap is still not completed), a ""cheese"" space positioned directly underneath the trap's cage, and a ""turn crank"" space. If a player lands on the ""turn crank"" space when an opponent is on the ""cheese"" space, the crank can be turned on the machine to launch it and trap that opponent. The winner is then the last one remaining after all the other players are captured.[3]
In 1975, the board game surrounding the trap was redesigned by Sid Sackson, adding the cheese pieces and allowing the player to maneuver opponents onto the trap space.[4]:36 Players collect cheese-shaped tokens during the game, and if the trap space is vacant when they land on the ""turn crank"" space, the tokens can be redeemed for a die roll to move an opponent.[3]
A modified version was released in the United Kingdom in 2004, featuring three mousetraps (with a specialized trigger working at random) and a completely different board and plastic components.[4]:38 Among the changed trap components in this version is the inclusion of a model toilet (which serves as the random trigger) instead of a model bathtub.[5]
A version of the game featuring characters from the Elefun and Friends universe was introduced in 2014.[6][7] Among the changes in this version, the trap is built before the start of the game, a spin wheel is used instead of dice, and the cheese pieces and their relevant rules are not included.[8]
Also in the 2010s, Hasbro introduced Classic Mousetrap with several major changes from the previous versions. The object in this game is to collect six cheese pieces. Instead of being eliminated from the game when caught by the trap, a player only forfeits a cheese piece to the opponent. The trap machine was modified, such as with the elimination of crank gears in favor of launching the trap by directly pulling the lever with the plastic stop sign.[9]

The character can jump on most enemies, strike them with his tail, or throw nuts he has collected at them to defeat them. Apart from bosses, most enemies can be killed with one strike. As with many games, contact with hazards and enemies that does not sufficiently defeat them results in losing one unit of health followed by a few seconds of invulnerability as the character sprite flashes. No version contains a time limit, the player may spend as long as they wish on each level, although some versions of the game will reward the player with bonus points for clearing a level quickly. Coins found along the way will not only give points and bonuses during gameplay, but the total amount of coins collected in a level will determine the player's completion bonus at the end of a level. Coins, health, and extra lives are often hidden throughout the levels.
The player starts with a limited number of lives and health units, the amounts are different depending on the difficulty and port. Losing all health results in losing one life and the player must restart at the beginning of the current journey. After losing all lives the player may choose to accept a game over or to continue but must then restart at the beginning of the first journey in the current stage with the default lives and health and zero nuts, coins and score. In all versions except the original Super NES version, passwords are shown when the player reaches certain levels and can be input to start the game from the beginning of that level.

Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness,,2004,Full Fat,NamcoNA / Zoo Digital PublishingPAL,"NA, PAL","Professor Pac learns that the evil forces have taken control of the Enchanted Castle, using black magic. The princess has vanished, and a witch named Mesmerelda is planning on stealing all four Gems of Virtue (Generosity, Truth, Wisdom, and Courage) to control the ""four wonders"" (areas of Pac-Land). These four areas each have enemies in them, and are blocked by mysterious force fields. Professor Pac creates a device called the Pactrometer, which allows Ms. Pac-Man to go to these areas to recover the gems before Mesmerelda can get them first.[6] However, as the Professor is telling Ms. Pac-Man this, he gets sucked into a mirror by the witch, leaving Ms. Pac-Man with the Pactrometer. As she journeys through the areas, she is helped by video messages that the Professor placed in the Pactrometer, and by holograms of Professor Pac.
As Ms. Pac-Man gathers the last of the gems, they are stolen by Mesmerelda. A battle ensues and the witch is defeated and runs away, leaving behind a key.[7] Without the key, Mesmerelda is unable to get into the castle to reach her crystal ball, and thus cannot use the gems.[8]
Ms. Pac-Man returns to fight for the gems, and this time wins, regaining the gems. With them and the Pactrometer, the witch's spell is broken, and Mesmerelda returns to her true form as the princess.[9] Professor Pac, Ms. Pac-Man, and the princess proceed to celebrate their victory.
","The player must navigate a series of mazes with Ms. Pac-Man. Along the way, she encounters such obstacles as moving blocks, exploding boxes, and locked doors. To help her, there is 'Pac-Dot Radar' to locate missing dots the player will need before being allowed to reach the next section of a level. Placed about the maze are such devices as spring tiles (to jump over the walls of the maze, and sometimes on top of them); switches, keys, hearts to regain her health, and 'Power Pellets' used to allow Ms. Pac-Man to eat all the enemies in the area for a limited time.[1]
As the player progresses, they must eat yellow dots scattered about each area, once they have eaten enough of these, a door will open, allowing them to reach a new section of that area. Each area has its own number of dots, as well as snacks such as fruit and pretzels. If the player can get all of these, as well as reaching the exit of the areas, they are rewarded with a 'Gold Star'. Once an area is beaten, the player can also play it again for a Time Trial, 'Gold Star', and 'Gold Clock'. Earning enough stars will unlock various features such as 'Bonus Rounds' between some levels, and a 'Movie Player' to watch the game's animated scenes.[2]
Each enemy and item that the player eats gives them more points, which can earn them additional lives, as well as allow them to unlock other features. After beating the two in-game bosses (the green 'Gobblin' and the final boss 'Mesmerelda'), the player receives the 'Witch's Key' which allows them to unlock various locations in the earlier areas. However, the game requires the player to beat the bosses twice in order to see the game's ending.[3] The multiplayer mode allows up to 4 people to play simultaneously (although a player can play solo, verse three computer-controlled characters).[4] The original arcade version of Ms. Pac-Man is freely playable as an option on the main menu, similar to how the original Pac-Man arcade game was freely available on the main menu of the 20th Anniversary Pac-Man World game. This was not included in the Game Boy Advance version.[5]

Need for Speed: Carbon â Own the City,,2006,EA Canada,EA Games,"NA, PAL","Carbon takes place within the fictional city of Palmont City. The city encompasses four boroughs - Kempton, which houses the city's industrial complexes; Downtown, which houses the city's metropolitan and financial buildings; Fortuna, which houses the city's residential area; and Silverton, which houses the city's casino & resort facilities - all linked together by a highway system, with the player able to enter all boroughs except Silverton, it is locked at the beginning of the game, but is unlocked once the player controls the other boroughs. The career introduction takes place in San Juan, which is not connected to Palmont, although the introduction ends with the player and one crew member somehow ending up in Palmont. There are several in game events in San Juan, but these events are not part of career mode. The city is surrounded by three canyons - East, West, and Carbon - each with their own layout of route, and which are also not connected to Palmont. The game's events and story all take place during night.
Several years prior to the events of Most Wanted, the player competed in a race around Palmont City against three others - Kenji, Angie, and Wolf - for a considerable cash pot, only for the city's police to disrupt the race towards the end. While the player was forced to escape the city, with assistance from  Darius (Tahmoh Penikett), another street racer, the police arrested everyone involved in the race, including the player's former girlfriend Nikki (Emmanuelle Vaugier); before leaving, she handed the player the bag containing the prize money, which in reality actually contained paper.
Following his time in the city of Rockport, the player returns to Palmont City, but finds himself pursued along a canyon route by Nathan Cross (Dean McKenzie) - a former Rockport police sergeant turned bounty hunter, who seeks revenge on the player for making a fool of him during his racing against Rockport's street racers. The chase culminates in the player totalling his BMW M3 GTR in a construction zone. Before Cross can arrest the player to collect his bounty, Darius arrives with his crew, the Stacked Deck, and pays him off, before offering the player assistance to start over in Palmont. Nikki, who now dates Darius due to her belief the player set up everyone in the race to steal the prize money, reluctantly helps on Darius' orders by introducing him to two crew members that can help in races, and providing him a safehouse to operate from.
Darius then advises the player to regain control of the different territories in Palmont, as each borough is controlled by a major crew headed up by one of the racers he competed against in the past, amongst a number of smaller crews - while Kenji controls Downtown with his crew Bushido, Angie controls Kempton with the 21st Street, and Wolf controls Fortuna with T.F.K. After defeating each crew's boss, a former member from their crew defects and joins the player's crew, revealing their observations the night the player was forced to leave Palmont, hinting that something was not right: Samson saw the driver of the car that opened up the escape alley was an undercover police officer, Yumi had a police scanner and saw the SWAT team when they used their EMPs to cripple Wolf, Kenji, and Angie's cars, and Colin saw someone collide with Nikki and swap the bag with the prize money with an identical one before running off with the real bag.[4] Shortly after all three crews are defeated, Darius calls a meeting with the player. Upon attending the meeting, Darius reveals that he was using the player to help his crew take control of the city, and betrays him to Cross to be arrested.
However, Nikki arrives to save the player, after making a secret deal with Cross. She immediately reveals that Darius had been responsible for the police disrupting the street race years ago - not only did he tip them off, he also switched out the prize money and let the player escape to set him up as the culprit for the police's sting.[5] Nikki reconciles with the player and joins his crew. Darius quickly finds out, and so hires the other bosses to join his crew and combat the player's own as he seeks to take over the Stacked Deck's control of Silverton.[6] The player successfully defeats the crew, ousting their control of the borough, and defeats Darius in a final race to take control of Palmont and accord justice for his actions. Before he leaves the city, after surrendering his car, Darius warns the player:
Enjoy it while it lasts. There's always someone out there, who's a little faster than you are. And sooner or later they're gonna catch up.[7]
","In the game, players take part in illegal street races that focus on different styles of races, utilizing a variety of licensed real-world cars (available at the time of the game's development and release) that can be upgraded and customized with new parts, while contending with the involvement of the police in their efforts to impede the player. Racing Events focus on competitive races with other drivers on circuits or point-to-point routes, checkpoint races, and races involving sprints or drifting (the latter being absent in its predecessor), with players able to use Nitrous Oxide and Speedbreaker whenever needed - either to help win races or get out of tight spots - both of which recharge over time. The game itself features four game modes - Career, Quick Race, Challenge Series, and Multiplayer - with the latter featuring online gameplay available in all console and PC versions of the game, except the Wii's edition.
The game operates on the same gameplay mechanics used in previous entries in the series, including its predecessor Most Wanted, though Carbon introduced new elements. A new element exclusive to Carbon are Canyon events - special racing events styled after Japanese TÅge racing, in which player compete in competitive racing on canyon roads outside the game's main setting. These events consist of sprints, drifting and duel events, in which the latter two feature a majority of destructible guardrails that the player must avoid crashing through or risk losing these respective events as a result. Duel events on these circuits operate differently to events involving major rival racers in Need for Speed games, as these are conducted across two stages on a canyon circuit - in each stage, one driver acts as the chaser and pursues the other at close proximity, with the first stage seeing the player as the chaser and scoring points the closer they can tail their opponent, while in the second stage their opponent becomes the chaser and the player must keep as much distance as possible to avoid losing too many points before the stage is completed. At the end of both stages the car who took the lead wins if their score is positive, otherwise their opponent wins if they turned it negative. Apart from scores, an instant win is possible depending on which mode the Duel is conducted in - in Career mode, the player can win instantly if they can stay ahead of their opponent for ten seconds, but lose if they fall behind for too long; in Online Multiplayer, a player wins if their opponent crashes through a guardrail.
Police pursuits, a staple of the series, function similar to Most Wanted in that police can turn up at any time during a race and attempt to impede the player during the event, except in Canyon Race events and checkpoint races; in Career mode, the police can also turn up during Free Roam, but will not act against the player unless they have a warrant (for evading a previous pursuit) or committed an offence in their sight, whereupon they focus on blocking in and arresting the player unless they can lose them and find a safe spot to hide until they lose their heat. As the player is pursued, they can either attempt to evade the cops, or knock them out of action by ramming their cars or using destructible props called Pursuit Breakers to impede their pursuit, though extensive pursuits will cause the player's heat level to rise, leading to stronger pursuit tactics including spike-strips, road blocks, and the involvement of state/federal authorities. Carbon modified the pursuit function by making police less dominant in arrest tactics at higher heat levels, and reducing the chance a Pursuit Breaker blocks/destroys a pursuing vehicle.
Licensed real-world cars used in the game are divided into three tiers (performance level) and three classes - Exotic, Tuner, and Muscle. For example, a Nissan 240SX is a tier 1 tuner car, while a Corvette Z06 is a tier 3 muscle car. Cars receive visual damage during the game, but no physical damage. Cars can be upgraded in performance through new components and fine-tuning of each component - such upgrades can help, for example, to improve speed, or improve braking. Carbon added the ability to customize visual parts via autosculpt parts, which allow adjustments of components for example, while adding flexibility with vinyls and decals by allowing them to be placed in layers over each other, with the ability to modify these in shape and size, and place them anywhere on the car. Additional cars and customization parts can be acquired through completing Reward Cards - each card consists of a set of challenges for the player to complete across the game modes, and reward the player either with a new vehicle to use or new parts for customization.
The game's main mode focuses on the player competing in races against rival street racing crews, instead of individual racers like in Most Wanted and Underground 2.  When starting in Career mode, players must choose a class that is not only permanent for their playthrough in this mode, but also dictates which of the initial three districts in the game's setting they begin in and which racing events are available first. Additional cars and classes become unlocked as the player progresses in this mode; any cars earned from Reward Cards for Quick Race mode are also available, but without limitation. Players operate their own crew in Career mode, and can recruit AI wingmen to assist them, each of whom operates under a different role - Blocker, Drafter, and Scout - and speciality - Fixer, Mechanic, and Fabricator. The type of role and speciality that each wingman operate under dictates how they assist the player - some can find shortcuts during races, while others can help to reduce police heat - with their role also dictating which car they drive in; the first two wingmen the player unlocks have their cars match the player's chosen class. During races, players may use their wingmen for a period of time, after which they must wait a while until their wingmen gauge has recharged before they can use them again.
To win career mode, players compete in races against other crews to secure territory - each district has a number of territories, each controlled either by the district's main crew or a minor crew through a series of racing events. Winning a majority of the races in a territory converts control to the player's crew and unlocks additional races elsewhere. Races that have been won can be engaged again, but the prize money offered is reduced as a result. Taking control of all territories will unlock a duel event with the main crew's boss, in which winning the event will allow the player to unlock special rewards, in a similar manner to the rewards offered in rival events in Most Wanted. As the player accumulates territories, they can lose any earned by losing control over its racing events to minor crews, either by failing to defeat them in takeover challenges or forfeiting the right to do so.
Quick Race mode allows players to create custom events for single player or multiplayer - both splitscreen or online - making use of any circuit and cars in the game, and altering various factors such as difficulty of opponents, track conditions and so forth; what cars and circuits can be used depends on the player's progress in Career mode, though all players can be allowed to use wingmen they have unlocked in these events, provided this option is allowed.
Challenge Series consists of a series of racing events that are divided into 12 categories, each divided further into three difficulty levels. Each challenge event requires the player to complete a specific goal, depending on the type of event, using a set car on a specific course in the game. Players may choose any category to begin with, unlike in Most Wanted, but must complete in order of Easy to Hard. Completing all of the difficulty levels of a challenge unlocks either a new car or customization option for the player to use in other modes.
Online Multiplayer mode focuses on two exclusive events for multiple players - Pursuit Knockout and Pursuit Tag:

Need for Speed: Most Wanted,,2005,EA Canada,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL","The fictional city of Rockport consists of three major districts (Rosewood, Camden Beach and Downtown Rockport) consisting of grimy industrial areas, more affluent suburbs, mountainous and wooded surroundings, a university campus, and a downtown core, with a mixture of road networks ranging from coastal roads to major highways. The setting is heavily influenced by cities in the United States' ""Rust Belt"" and Pacific Northwest with some resemblance to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon. Much of the game's events and story take place in a fixed time-period between sunrise and sunset, compared to the previous title's races that took place at night.
The game begins with the player taking part in a sprint race against Clarence ""Razor"" Callahan (Derek Hamilton), in order to take his #15 spot on the blacklist. During the race, the player receives a call stating that his custom painted BMW M3 GTR suffered an oil leak at the start line, and that the player had to end the race fast. Despite the warning, the engine seizes due to lack of oil.
In a flashback to a few days ago, the player is seen arriving at Rockport for the very first time, hoping to take part in the city's illegal street racing scene. Upon arriving, he meets with Mia Townsend (Josie Maran) in her Mazda RX-8, who offers to help him get started. He also crosses paths with Sergeant Jonathan Cross (Dean McKenzie), the city's top traffic police officer in the Rockport Police Department (RPD) who drives a custom-painted Chevrolet Corvette police interceptor, along with his unnamed partner (Simone Bailly). Cross seeks to bring down the ""Blacklist"", a group of the fifteen most-wanted drivers sought by the RPD[3] and declares that street racing in Rockport is ""finished"". Cross almost arrests the player before being forced to answer another street racing distress call; Cross leaves after keying the player's car. The player starts competing with other street racers, such as Ronald ""Ronnie"" McCrea (Paul Dzenkiw), and befriends fellow racer Rog (AndrÃ© Sogliuzzo). He soon catches the attention of Razor, who underestimates the player and dispatches Toru ""Bull"" Sato (Kevan Ohtsji) to defeat the player; Bull is defeated instead. The player thus receives the chance to race against Razor in a ""pink slip"" race and the timeline comes back to the present.
The player loses the race due to the oil leak caused by Ronnie sabotaging the player's car under Razor's directions, and Razor soon claims the player's BMW for himself before fleeing with the other racers, as Cross and the RPD arrive. With no car to escape, the player is arrested.
After some time, the player is released from custody due to lack of evidence and is picked up by Mia. She explains that Razor had the BMW sabotaged to win it, and used it to take the #1 spot on the Blacklist. Providing the player with a safehouse and helping him buy a new car, Mia recommends that the player work up the Blacklist himself, defeating each of its racers, in order to challenge Razor and win back his car.[4] In exchange for her help, including the involvement of Rog, Mia asks for the unquestioned placement of large ""side bets"" on the player's street races. As the player makes progress, Rog contacts the player to inform him that Mia's bets are earning her large amounts of money that will likely attract RPD's attention, and suggests he keeps a distance from her.
Eventually, the player becomes #2 on the Blacklist and attracts Razor's attention from the reputation he had accumulated over time, culminating in the pair racing against each other. The player manages to defeat Razor and recover the BMW from him, but quickly learn that Mia is an undercover police officer for the RPD, who had been working to bring down the Blacklist from the inside for Cross.[5] As the RPD begins to arrive on the scene, Mia advises the player to run, as Razor and the Blacklist racers are arrested, despite several of them trying to flee when they realize Mia lured them into the RPD's ambush. Cross, angered at Mia's inability to arrest the player as well, calls in a city-wide police hunt for him.[6] Unable to return to the safehouses due to Cross knowing about his location, the player finds himself aggressively pursued around the city. Mia soon contacts him, directing him to jump from a derelict bridge outside the city limits. The player successfully evades the cops by reaching it and leaves Rockport.[7] In a post-credits scene, Cross creates a national-level warrant for the player and his BMW, adding him to the National Most Wanted List. These events would eventually lead to the next game, Need For Speed: Carbon.
","In the game, players take part in illegal street races across Most Wanted's setting, utilizing a variety of licensed real-world cars (available at the time of the game's development and release) that can be upgraded and customized with new parts, while contending with the involvement of the police in their efforts to impede the player. Racing events feature a mixture of competitive racing across circuit or point-to-point races, and checkpoint, sprint and drag races. The game features three modes of play - Career, Quick Race, and Challenge Series - with a fourth mode allowing for multiplayer being available to players on certain console editions. While many of the racing events feature those used in previous entries in the games, particularly the Underground set of games, some events - Drifting, Street X, Underground Racing League tournaments and Outrun - are absent from Most Wanted, and replaced with two new ones. The first event is Tollbooth, a checkpoint-styled solo race, in which players must hit a set of checkpoints, each one within a set amount of time; reaching a checkpoint quickly adds the time left over to the timer for the next checkpoint. The second event is Speedtrap, in which players compete in a competitive checkpoint race, and must hit each checkpoint at their fastest speed; upon crossing the finishing line, each checkpoint's total speed is accumulated to determine the winner. Speed accumulated by the player or opponent gets deducted by 10Â km/hr after an opponent crosses the finish line first; this is signified by intermittent flashing on-screen until the player (or the other opponent cars) crosses the finish line.
The game features a selection of stock cars to choose from, each of which can be modified during the game's career mode with upgrades to enhance its performance and visual appearance. Customization of the car's appearance is limited; the main emphasis of customization is to reduce the car's heat level rather than for reputation as in the Underground series - while some elements that were possible in the previous installments were removed, other received minor changes such as players being able to make use of whole body kits on cars, the use of only one vinyl for the vehicle, and exterior colors being limited to the car's main body, wheels and window tinting. Additional cars are also available for the player to use - most of which are acquired from the game's Blacklist Racers or unlocked after defeating a Blacklist Racer, while others are bonuses available from completing challenges; a number of cars available in the game are exclusives added in by the Black Edition copy of the game. Police cars cannot be driven in the game, except during special events in the game's Challenge Series mode. Most Wanted, like the Underground series, avoids the use of major vehicle damage on all racing models, with only scratched paint and heavily cracked windshields constituting the whole of the racers' damage modeling. Police cars on the other hand, sustain heavy damage when hit by the player's car or caused by the player to crash into other cars or obstacles.
During races and the game's Career mode, players can make use of Nitrous Boosts to help give them an edge against opponents. Unlike in Underground, which first introduced the gameplay mechanic, Nitrous Boosts recharge over time, thus allowing player to re-use it when needed. Players can also use a second ability to help out in tough situations called ""Speedbreaker"" - when used, the ability slows down time (similar to bullet time), induces drift and momentarily increase the weight of the player's vehicle to make it harder to be pushed around, thus allowing players to maneuver their vehicle out of a difficult situation.
While the concept of players being engaged by police was first introduced in Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit, the development of Most Wanted saw the gameplay mechanic enhanced and firmly introduced into the series through the employment of a complex system. When players become engaged in a police pursuit, usually from conducting a traffic offence (referred to as ""Infractions"" in the game) in sight of a police unit (such as speeding), their aim at this point is to escape from the pursuit by either evading or taking out pursuing vehicles. The game's on-screen HUD is modified during a pursuit, including highlighting pursuing police units on the mini-map, displaying the vehicle's heat level, and adding a Pursuit bar at the bottom detailing the number of police units in the pursuit, how many have been evaded, and how many have been taken out. The pursuit system calculates how the police handle the player via the heat level accumulated against the player's current car. Heat accumulates from committing offences and continually evading capture by the police, with higher levels of heat causing the police to be more aggressive, from employing additional tactics and tools (such as roadblocks, spike strips, and police helicopters), to involving stronger, faster police cars such as police SUVs and Federal units. If a player has only one car actively pursuing them, reinforcements may be called in and arrive after a period of time.
Players can lose the police through skillful driving, making use of their special abilities, ramming pursuing vehicles and utilizing ""Pursuit Breakers"" - environmental traps, highlighted on the mini-map, which when triggered cause a certain number of police vehicles to be taken out of action, such as smashing through a gas station. Evading and losing the police - either by disabling/immobilizing vehicles, gaining some distance from pursuers, or a combination of both - does not end a pursuit, once there are no more active vehicles. Instead, the player enters a ""cooldown"" period when this happens, which pauses the pursuit (and any reinforcements being called in), they must hide and avoid being spotted by police for a period of time. The length of time for this period is longer at higher levels of heat, but can be decreased significantly if the player reaches and hides in special concealment spots around the game's setting, which are marked on the mini-map during this phase and place them out of sight of police units. A pursuit fully ends when the player successfully escapes the police, or is overwhelmed and trapped, and thus ""busted"" as a result.
In the game's main mode, the objective is to race against each of the setting's major street racers (or Blacklist Racer) and defeat them. Initially, players begin by completing a tutorial sequence of events to ease players into the game, whereupon they must choose a car to use for the rest of the game. The selection available is limited, but more become available as the player defeats each Blacklist racer, including better performance upgrades for these, with players able to sell any car acquired at any time during the game - cars can be bought at car lots, while upgrades and customization parts can be bought at garages. Events in this mode are divided into two categories - Racing events, and Milestones. While Racing events focus on the game's main series of racing events which earn money rewards when won, Milestones focus on completing specific objectives, most of which usually involve being involved in a police pursuit and raising the player's Bounty - a form of currency detailing how much trouble the player has caused for the police in the game's setting, based on the number of offences and damage to property they had caused. An example of a Milestone can be the player being required to enter a police pursuit and then attempting to escape it within a set amount of time.
Police pursuits in this mode can occur in Free Roam, during a race, or from activating one in the game's pause menu - the latter can be done only if there are any Milestones yet to be completed. Although police units will mainly impede a player if they begin pursuing them in a race, they will attempt to arrest them when in Free Roam. If the police achieve this, the player is fined based on their heat level, which is reset, and their car is given an impound strike - if the player cannot pay their fine, or receive a third strike on their car, it is impounded and lost; losing all of their cars this way and having no money to buy a new one, automatically ends the game. If the player escapes pursuit, the car retains the heat level it accumulated, but can lose this by either having its visual looks changed, or by driving another vehicle for a period of time. Players can view a statistic screen at any time during this mode to view their records regarding infractions, cost to state, deployed tactics and pursuit lengths.
To take on each Blacklist Racer, players must complete events and Milestones associated to them, whereupon they must win against the racer in a successive series of races - the number increases as the player progresses in the story. Defeating a Blacklist Racer not only unlocks the next opponent and a new series of events, along with new Milestones to achieve, but also unlocks additional cars and upgrade parts as well, along with allowing the player to claim two rewards from them. Each Blacklist Racer has six rewards they can offer when defeated. While three of these rewards consist of special customization parts and unique performance upgrades, the other three, concealed from the player until selected, consist of the racer's personal car - a uniquely modified vehicle - and two randomly selected bonus functions - extra money; impound recovery of lost vehicles; a ""get-out-of-jail-free-card""; the removal of an impound strike on any car. Any component Markers selected can be acquired by visiting the garages after returning to Free Roam. In addition, defeating specific Blacklist Racers also unlock access to the other districts of the city - the player has access to one district to begin with, but unlocks more as they progress in the game, including additional safehouses.
In Quick Race mode, players can enter any event they wish and use any car that they want, while opting to either make custom parameters for the event (i.e. number of laps), or let the game create a random set of parameters. The number of events and cars to choose from depend on the player's progress in the game's Career mode.
In Challenge Series mode, players take part in a successive series of events, in which completing one unlocks the next event. While around half of these are focused on checkpoint races, the other consist of a mixture of pursuit events akin to the Milestone events in Career Mode, with each event tasking the player to complete its goal using a specific vehicle on a specific route/from a starting position, and beginning on a certain level of heat. Vehicles for each event are pre-tuned, and range from various cars available in Career mode, to those not accessible such as dump trucks and police cars. Completing specific challenges reward the player with bonus cars for use in Career and Quick Race mode.
Multiplayer in Most Wanted consists of online modes, which were available for the Xbox 360, Xbox, PC and PlayStation Portable editions of the game. Up to 4 players can participate in an online race and can race in 4 game modes including circuit, sprint, lap knockout and speed trap. Furthermore, there is the option to enable Performance Matching in an online race - all cars in the race are automatically upgraded to match the performance (i.e. top speed, handling, etc.) of the fastest car in that particular race. However, as soon as the race is over, all modifications made to the cars by performance matching are removed. The online multiplayer lobby was shut down on August 1, 2011,[2] though it is still possible to play the game in multiplayer, but through an unofficial, open beta modification called ""Most Wanted Online"".[citation needed]

Need for Speed: Underground,,2003,Pocketeers,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL","The player races in Olympic City in a modified Acura Integra R sporting wide body kits and easily winning over his opponents; only to be woken up by Samantha from his sleep.
Samantha is the player's friend in Olympic City and she tours him across the import culture scene and illegal street racing therein. She helps the player buy his first car, although she mocks the player's choice of the car by calling it ""weak"". The player also encounters several street racing crews, some of them being Samantha's acquaintances who befriend the player after he proves his racing skills to them. She introduces him to T.J, one of her acquaintances, who promises him with numerous upgrades and parts, provided he wins races. The player races other racers and wins them over, eventually drawing the attention of Eddie, the leader of the Eastsiders gang and Melissa, his beautiful girlfriend. Eddie is the current best underground racer in Olympic City and berates the player for his racing skills, going as far as mocking him to ""take a taxi home so that he can get home faster"", but the player proves otherwise. Enraged, Eddie challenges the player to race Samantha, who gets infuriated upon the player's acceptance. She loses after she wrecks her Honda Civic Si during the race, and her car is taken by T.J for himself thereafter and vandalizes it. Deeply saddened by the loss of her car to T.J, Samantha distances herself from the player.
The player eventually keeps winning races offered by Samantha's acquaintances in her absence and later on faces T.J in Samantha's vandalized Civic. T.J loses the race and returns the car to the player, who returns it back to Samantha. They rekindle their friendship and Samantha motivates the player to race Eddie and defeat him once and for all. Eddie challenges the player to a sprint race and loses; while the player's crew are about to celebrate, a mysterious grey Nissan 350Z challenges the player to a final race. The player races the 350Z and wins; while the others celebrate his victory, the driver of the 350Z is revealed to be Melissa.
That event solidifies the player's status as the best underground racer in Olympic City.
","Circuit is a standard race that involves racing with up to three opponents' cars around a loop track for one lap or more, and is the main mode of the game. For about the last 4 races of underground mode, the number of players decreases to only 1 rival, and the number of laps reach up to seven (endurance race).
Knockout Mode is similar to previous Need for Speed titles, and involves ""knocking out"" the last racer who passes the starting line in each lap until the final leader of the race remains, and wins the race. In the case of Underground, Knockout sessions have a maximum of three laps for four racers.
Sprint mode is a variation on the Circuit mode, where the contestants race in a point-to-point track instead of loop tracks. These races are typically shorter than ""circuits"" (with a maximum of 8Â km in length), so players are required to be more cautious of any mistakes during racing, such as crashing into barriers or vehicles.
Drifting is the most challenging and technical aspect of the game. Drift mode consists of one player in a short loop track, where the objective is to collect as many points as possible by drifting along the track. The player competes with three other contestants, who appear to accumulate scores along with the player during the drift session. The player would be required to beat these scores in order to obtain top positions.
Bonuses are awarded for players who drift in the outer borders of the track, drift vertically, or perform chained-drifting (continuous drifting by constantly steering the vehicle during drifts to maintain speed); if the player succeeds in ending a drift without collisions onto the sides of the track, the collected points are added into the score, otherwise, the collected points are cancelled.
Drift mode is the only type of racing where time taken to complete the track does not matter, since players are given the freedom to complete the allocated number laps at their own pace. This may explain the absence of nitrous oxide in this mode, since it serves no apparent purpose in this situation.
Drag racing is the second most technical form of race in the game. It involves racing against one or three cars on typically straight tracks, and attempting to obtain top positions to win. Players are forced to use manual transmission in this mode. In order to master Drag mode, players must employ good timing and reflexes for gear shifting, redlining, overtaking, and the use of nitrous oxide boosts. Because the player is going to put the engine to its limits the mode places particular emphasis in monitoring the tachometer and the engine temperature during races, which is enlarged and situated on the leftmost portion of the screen. Steering in this mode is simplified to simply allow for lane changes, while the computer handles the steering along the lanes, and the player focuses more on maintaining an optimum speed for the car.
Two conditions will result in players being forfeited during a drag race: head-on collisions with an opponent, barriers, traffic cars or dividers (being 'totaled'); or blown engines as a result from prolonged redlining and the subsequent overheating of the engine.
In the car customization menu, cars can be altered with performance upgrades and visual upgrades, such as paint colors, vinyls, neon, custom front and rear bumpers, custom side skirts, spoilers, custom hoods, exhaust tips, roof scoops, custom tires and stickers, and wide body kits.
Players have the ability to increase their car's performance by applying performance upgrades to the car.  The player can upgrade their car's engine, drivetrain, suspension, tires, engine control unit (ECU)  as well as add nitrous oxide, turbo chargers and reduce the car's weight (in the form of âweight reduction packagesâ).

Need for Speed: Underground 2,,2004,Pocketeers,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL","The story begins after the player has beaten Eddie and his street gang - ""The Eastsiders"" along with Melissa in Olympic City and is now revered as the best street racer in Olympic City. After a race, the player is called by an unidentified man with an ""invitation"" to join his team and that he ""is not taking no for an answer."" The player ends the call without answering and starts driving to a party but is ambushed by a Hummer H2 that rams his Nissan Skyline GT-R, wrecking it. A man with a scythe tattoo on his hand calls to confirm that he ""took care of a problem.""
Six months later, the player boards a plane to Bayview with a good luck note from Samantha that also refers to her friend, Rachel Teller. The player arrives in Bayview, buys his first car using the money provided by the insurance on his totalled Nissan Skyline, and starts racing again. The player soon gains fame and sponsorship deals from winning races and gets the attention of ""The Wraiths"" and their leader, Caleb Reece. Caleb is revealed to be the driver of the Hummer that wrecked the player's car in Olympic City.
Rachel reveals to the player that Caleb is attempting to take control of the racing scene in Bayview by manipulating the sponsorship deals in his favour, threatening the player's livelihood, and Rachel's liaison with the sponsors. Caleb attempts to have the player lose an Underground Racing League tournament by placing Nikki Morris, a Wraith member, in the same tournament as the player. This ultimately fails, and Nikki leaves the Wraiths after Caleb berates her for losing; she then joins Rachel and the player's side. Nikki warns them of the consequences of Caleb's plan if he takes over the city's street racing scene.
Desperate to stop the player, Caleb eventually puts all of the remaining Wraiths members in an Underground Racing League tournament against the player, which fails and after losing another sponsor, Caleb challenges the player to a showdown. The player wins the race and celebrates with Rachel and Nikki while Caleb is left insolvent and defeated.
That event solidifies the player's status as the best Underground racer in Bayview.
","Racing modes are roughly similar to Underground; one racing mode was dropped, this being the Knockout competitions. Yet, a Lap Knockout option is available when racing Circuit in non-career races.
Unlike Underground, time plays a crucial role here, especially in parkade tracks; if the opponents end up crossing the finish line way before the player, a 30-second timer will start within which the players will have to accumulate drift points until the timer runs out or they cross the finish line.
Apart from these, four new race variations have also been provided in Underground 2:
The races are divided into 5 ""stages"". Once any stage is completed, the race locations of that stage will be replaced by the counterparts of the next stage. A ""World Map"" feature includes a menu of races for all prior stages, denoting races that have been completed and yet to be completed. After completing stage 2 through stage 5 (these stages require completing some number of ""DVD"" events), there will always be 8 sponsor races that will not be completed, since a player has to choose a single sponsor per stage and can only run 3 out of 11 unique sponsor races, leaving 8 sponsor races incomplete at the end of each stage. These can only be run using World Map. Due to a game bug (at least on the PC version), if running a non-completed race from the World Map, no credit (cash or rep) will be awarded unless the player restarts at least once after the race starts.
Underground 2 is unique in the Need for Speed series in the sense that it requires a player to drive to a certain place in the city to begin a race (other games allow the player to select a race from a menu). Most races are marked on the in-game radar, but some are hidden and the player must search for them, should they decide to play them. The following features aid the players in this regard:
As in Need for Speed: Underground, Underground 2 continues to offer similar vehicles for purchase and modification, most of which consist of Japanese models such as Nissan 240SX, Nissan Skyline R34, or Mitsubishi Eclipse, with some European and American models. Also, Underground 2 is the first game in the Need for Speed series to offer three SUVs as racing vehicles. Also, it is the second game in the Need for Speed series after Underground to offer a Korean-made car (Hyundai Tiburon) as a racing vehicle. There are two versions of the game, US and EU, where each version has 29 of 31 possible cars: the US version has an Acura RSX and a Honda Civic, while the EU version instead has a Peugeot 106 and a Vauxhall Corsa, the rest of the 27 cars in both versions are the same.
SUVs, also known as sport utility vehicles, were a new element added to Underground 2. The SUVs can be upgraded and tuned in the same manner as cars. Some of the events in career mode are SUV-only events and only appear when a player is driving an SUV. In career or any offline mode, if the player is driving an SUV, the computer opponents also drive SUVs. However, after completing a stage, the World Map allows a player to run any event from prior stages in either a car or an SUV.
Customization in Underground 2 was significantly expanded compared to previous iterations from the series. Visual customization has expanded with the ability to customize the car's front and rear bumpers, side skirts, spoiler, hood, exhaust tips, doors, roof scoop, wheels (including the ability to put on spinners), headlights and taillights, side mirrors and paint. Vinyls and decals can also be added, as well as car stereos (speakers, amplifiers & subwoofers), hydraulics, nitrous bottles, and under glow neon. Most visual modifications to the car have no actual effect on vehicle performance. The sound systems, for example, could be put in the trunk of cars but served no purpose other than visual cues. Hydraulics can be used in combination with nitrous at a start of a race which can cause a car to do a wheelie and for some cars get a better launch. The performance and handling of the car are affected by cosmetic modifications[citation needed] like spoilers and hoods, which affect the downforce of the car - better spoilers allow better tuning of the downforce management both in front and in the back of the vehicle. Visual upgrades increase a car's visual rating, up to a rating of 10.0. At least one car in a career garage needs to be visually upgraded to a 10.0 rating to unlock all 10 DVD events (completing these rewards the player with a DVD cover), and each stage has a required number of DVD events.
A car's performance can be enhanced by upgrading the car's engine, engine control unit (ECU), transmission, suspension, tires, brakes, reducing the car's weight, and adding a turbo and/or nitrous. The player has the ability to either upgrade the performance through upgrade packages or by purchasing individual parts of each performance category. NFS: Underground 2 also introduces a dyno-tuning system which allows players to specifically tune certain aspect of the car such as ECU, turbo, suspension springs, front and rear shock absorbers, gear ratios, aerodynamics, brake bias, individual tire grip, etc. The player can test the settings via a dyno run which will display a torque and power versus rpm graph, and an estimated 0â60Â mph (0â100Â km/h) time.
Underground 2 had online multiplayer capability on PS2, PC, and Xbox, however by 2010, EA Games had shut down their servers, rendering the feature inoperable.[3][4] The PC version has a multiplayer LAN mode, and multiplayer races over the internet can still be run using the games LAN mode and a virtual LAN (a virtual private network).

Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed,,2005,Pocketeers,Destination Software,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed gives the player the opportunity to race Porsche cars (including 3 race cars) throughout a range of tracks located in Europe. There are two career modes, an evolution mode, where the player starts with Porsche cars made in 1950 with the first 356 and ends with Porsche cars made in 2000 with the 996 and factory driver mode, where the player goes through a series of events like slalom, stunts, and races, using Porsche cars preselected for each event. The player can customize their cars drawing from an in-depth catalog of different Porsche as well as aftermarket parts. Unlike previous games in the series, there are no pursuit modes. Some factory driver events include police cars, but the police cars only attempt to impede the players car during certain sprint events.
The factory driver mode introduces the first storyline in the Need For Speed series. The player's goal is to become a Porsche factory driver by completing a series of events. The game uses pop-up windows, each with an image of an existing Porsche factory team member, and text describing the next event, and also commenting on the player's progress. In some cases, a timed course such as a slalom notes the required time to pass, but also mentions the current team record, where beating the record is optional and the post event pop-up will note if the player set a new record or not. The events involve stunts, like doing two 180 degree spins (the first one leaves the players car driving backwards for a bit), slalom courses, delivery (time limited sprints with police that interfere with the player's car), normal sprint and circuit races.

NHL Hitz 2003,,2002,Exient Entertainment,Midway,,NaN,"Players have the option of playing three periods in one, two, or three minutes in length. To begin the game, a center, a winger, a defenceman, and a goalie are picked for each team. Prior to each period, substituting the players or simply leaving them in the game is an option. There is an option for a mercy rule that will end the game as soon as the team reaches the limit of goal differential. As an example, if the mercy rule is set to five, as soon as a team leads the game by five goals, that team automatically wins. It can also be set to one goal, similar to overtime. Another nuance to the game is the option to make players who lose fights leave the game. The game is also meant to mainly be a hard-hitting, arcade-style game with wildly exaggerated player movements and actions. For example, players can check other players through the glass and into the stands, but won't stop play. Also, goalies can actually stick-handle the puck around, and take a shot on the other net, sometimes scoring. Also, the rosters are shortened to mainly starters and fan favorites (such as Tie Domi and Bob Probert), with far fewer free agents. There are also many mini-games to play.
The tournament is to complete goals in the game to get experience points, which are like stat points. When players win more, they get better equipment, like sticks for accuracy and power, goalie pads for better rebound control, and more. They create a team with the goal of joining the NHL, and they start off picking the team, logo, etc., and then create seven players. As the player progresses, beating teams will result in the teams getting harder, but at the same time their team will improve too. When they start winning games, three more players will eventually ask to join the team, and the player can customize them. There are eight rounds with 5-6 teams in each one around the globe. In the last few rounds, the player will face NHL teams and players and be awarded with the trophy if they emerge victorious. They are faced with a worldwide quest, taking on teams internationally in places such as Brooklyn, Maui, Monte Carlo, Stockholm, and Montego Bay.
A season mode is available. If the player-controlled team qualifies for them, a full playoff schedule will begin. This time, however, there are more individual awards made by the creators. There are also end-of-season awards created by the makers of the game, such as trophies for the player who wins the most fights or delivered the most hits.

Nicktoons Racing,,2002,Software Creations,Infogrames / Nickelodeon,"NA, PAL","Various Nickelodeon characters each receive a letter invitation to compete in a Grand Prix for the top prize, the Krusty Krab Big Bun Award. The host of the competition, also the individual who sent the invitations, is an unknown, unseen driver of a sleek, black car with a tinted dome window simply dubbed as the Mystery Rider, which the participating racers are challenged to beat, as well as each other. Upon arriving and being announced by the Race Announcer, the Mystery Rider and other Nicktoons speed off to begin their first race.
Once the player ultimately completes the game and wins the final Cup to obtain the Krusty Krab Big Bun Award, their playable Nicktoon receives a year supply of Krabby Patties as it is hitched to their go-kart. The Mystery Rider arrives in his cart and is revealed to be Plankton. It stated by the Announcer that Plankton created the entire series of races as a plan to obtain the Krabby Patty secret formula. The winning racer then rides off into the sunset with their Krabby Patties and the credits begin to play.
","Nicktoons Racing focuses on engaging players in go-kart racing through various Nicktoons-themed circuit tracks in a variety of different modes, similar to the Mario Kart series. The game features a wide selection of playable characters from various 1990's Nicktoons. The game offers an Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty for the gameplay (with the game allowing you to unlock subsequently harder modes by accomplishing the last difficulty fully in Cups). The game also has a multiplayer option and can be played with a second player via split-screen utilization (multiplayer is available to all versions of the game except the Game Boy Color).
Each track features power-up presents that allow the player to gain advantages against their fellow racers in the form of various weapons and obstructions, as well as small orbs that a racer can collect and utilize to get a short-term speed boost. Each track also contains a variety of alternate routes and shortcuts that allow the various racers to shorten their laps (the harder the difficulty selected by the player, the more likely the NPCs are to utilize the shortcuts).
The primary mode for the racing gameplay. This mode allows the player(s) to take control of one of the Nicktoon racers and compete in a series of 4 races in the form of a Cup. There are 3 Cups and the second and third have to be unlocked by beating the previous Cup series. This is the mode required to beat the game's main story, unlock all the tracks for other modes of play, unlock The Mystery Rider as a playable kart, and the bonus minigames.
A mode that can be used by the player to test their speed ability on each unlocked track. After finishing your first lap, a ghost racer will appear and perform the lap as the player did it on previous lap.
A mode that allows the player(s) to race a single track without competing in a Cup. The player progressively earns random collectible rewards for a trophy shelf the more races they participate at in a row and win.
A mode that is generally the same as Race for Fun, but for two players instead. This mode does not feature collectibles.
A mode that allows the player(s) to pick three characters and race them in a 3-lap relay where each character performs one lap before tagging in the next racer. If the player hits their next racer directly, they get an initial speed boost for their next lap.
Besides the main racing tracks, the game also has a single-player and multiplayer specific bonus minigame that you unlock as you play-through and beat all the cups in Medium and Hard Mode.

Nicktoons Unite!NA|SpongeBob SquarePants and Friends Unite!PAL,,2005,Climax Group,THQ,"NA, PAL","The gamer is first introduced to SpongeBob SquarePants, who realizes that Plankton has taken over Bikini Bottom. Then Goddard exits a portal, and displays a message to SpongeBob from Jimmy Neutron. Following Goddard through the portal, he meets Jimmy, Danny Phantom, and Timmy Turner. Jimmy coats SpongeBob with self-regenerating moisture to keep him healthy. Jimmy then explains that his latest invention, the Universe Portal Machine (a device to open portals to other dimensions) had been copied by Prof. Calamitous, who went on to use it to form a Syndicate with Plankton, Vlad Plasmius, and Denzel Crocker; they have already begun stealing energy from each of their worlds for their masterplan. Since Calamitous' lair cannot be found, they start with the other worlds first by stopping the Syndicate from siphoning any more energy.
The heroes arrive in Vlad's new castle by accident, where he reveals his ghost portal is siphoning energy from the Ghost Zone to further the Syndicate's plans, and as a precaution, Vlad has captured Danny's parents. Vlad then knocks them out and imprisons them in the Ghost Zone Prison. Befriending the Box Ghost, the heroes escape after knocking out Walker. Danny leads the heroes to the Fenton Works ghost portal, where he claims no relation to the Fentons and that they are Ghost Hunter experts. They meet Danny's friends, Sam and Tucker, who explain that some ghosts have possessed the citizens. Danny drives out the ghosts before the group cuts through the Amity Park Graveyard to Vlad's castle. Upon arrival, Jimmy realizes there are generators keeping the portal open. The gang destroys the generators, thus shutting off the portal. Confronting Vlad, Danny possesses his dad Jack, using the 'Ghost Gauntlets' to pummel Vlad. Vlad gloats the Syndicate is building something and they already have sufficient ghost energy to help power it before fleeing.
The heroes' next destination is Bikini Bottom (with Jimmy, Danny, and Timmy using Jimmy's air gum to breathe underwater). They meet Sandy, who explains that Plankton is using harvesters to capture jellyfish to extract power from their sting; he has also imprisoned Mr. Krabs. Sandy sends them to Jellyfish Fields to meet Patrick, but upon meeting him, he is sucked into a harvester. After destroying the harvesters, the group find themselves on the Flying Dutchman's ship; for he wants them (minus SpongeBob since he's annoying) to be his new crew. However, Danny persuades him to let them go in exchange for bringing back his old crew. Upon arriving at the Chum Bucket, they free Patrick and the jellyfish. On the roof, they face Plankton, using a robotic crab, and rescue Mr. Krabs. The heroes then learn that the Syndicate is extracting energy for a Doomsday Device, and Crocker is still supplying power to it.
In Dimmsdale, the heroes infiltrate Crocker's golden fortress, finding a rainbow of Fairy Magic ending there. After cutting off the fortress' supply of Fairy Magic, they arrive in Fairy World and Since Jimmy has been here before, he gives an incorrect explanation about it not being real. They encounter Jorgen von Strangle, who explains that Crocker is extracting the magic from the Big Wand to feed the Doomsday Machine. After freeing the fairies, they reach The Big Wand, where they defeat Crocker flying a massive exosuit fueled by Fairy Magic. SpongeBob and Danny deduce that the villains have retreated to Retroville in order to regroup after being defeated. Timmy, on the other hand, believes everything will be okay with the Big Wand giving fairies back their full magic, by wishing the bad guys into jail and the dismantling of the Doomsday machine. However, Wanda announces that Da Rules only allow changes to Dimmsdale's dimension, disappointing the heroes.
They return to Jimmy's lab, where they meet Cindy Vortex when suddenly Calamitous contacts them, revealing that the Doomsday Machine is almost finished. SpongeBob sees Goddard scratching himself and says he should take a bath, making Jimmy realize Calamitous planted a flea-bot in Goddard to spy on him. Realizing that the only way to stop Calamitous is to trace the flea-bot's signal, the heroes use Jimmy's shrink ray to shrink down and enter Goddard, and after defeating the flea-bot, Jimmy hacks the flea-bot's circuitry to locate Calamitous' lair. Upon arrival, the Syndicate declares that the current world of Retroville will be destroyed as a show of their power, and the machine will protect them from the destruction. Despite the heroes' damaging the machine, the villains continue the count down. SpongeBob miraculously unplugs the Doomsday Machine, and  Calamitous laments that he had forgotten to finish the back-up power supply.
With Calamitous in prison, the heroes part ways. Jimmy gives the heroes each a Neutronic Recaller in case of a future incident. SpongeBob leaves first, most likely holding Plankton captive in his pocket. Danny gives Jimmy a second Fenton Thermos that he had made with Jimmy's matter copier (since Vlad is trapped in the original), which Jimmy thinks will help him figure out what ""those phantasm images really were."" Timmy thanks Jimmy for a Hyber-Cube, which is holding Crocker captive. Cindy waves Timmy off. After this, Jimmy shouts a familiar line: ""Cindy, get out of my lab!""
","In the console version, the player can play with three computers and no other human players, or with a friend or two with the remaining computer(s). One can switch abilities, which have multiple uses. There are also things only a certain character can do. For example, SpongeBob is needed to use Bubble Bombs to blow up a pillar, Danny is needed to use Ghostly Wail on some glass, Timmy is needed to use Freeze Glove to freeze some water, or Jimmy has to shoot down some things with his Neutron Flare.
Goddard can be found in all four worlds (and oddly enough, inside himself) so he can upgrade the player's weapons and abilities.
The DS version is a full 3D platformer where the player controls one of the four characters at a time, which can be selected at any moment via the touchscreen, while the GBA version is a 2D platformer in which the player must alternate between the two characters given at the beginning of the level in order to progress. It uses pre-rendered 3D sprites based on the models of the DS version.

Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots,,2007,Firemint,THQ,,"The opening intro for the game features Professor Calamitous on a game show called the Biggest Genius. Calamitous states that by feeding fairies Krabby Patties, they can emit a magical gas that, combined with Ghost energy, can be used as a form of fuel for his army of ""Toybots"".
As the opening credits are shown, the game itself opens with Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants delivering a truckload of several million Krabby Patties to a Krabby Patty processing and toybot factory. Upon arriving at the factory, a robot sucks up all the Krabby Patties, and Patrick, unintentionally, in the process. SpongeBob chases after the robot, and eventually finds his way into the factory.
After finding his way through the factory, SpongeBob finds Patrick vacuum-packed like a toy. After freeing Patrick, they meet Tak, of the Pupununu People, who claims to have been abducted and scanned. They later find Timmy Turner, Jenny Wakeman (XJ-9), Rocko, GIR, Stimpy and Jimmy Neutron, all of whom also claim to have been abducted and scanned. They meet the Chad-Bot, a robot who is the Professor's helper. They ask him to use something to contact Danny Phantom and he commands them to find more master models for his collection.
After collecting the master models, Jimmy contacts Danny, who says that Calamitous' invading toy army took over his house to use the energy coming from the Ghost Zone and its surrounding with robots, that looks like him and Sam. So Jimmy tells Danny and Sam to meet him and the other Nicktoons at the Amity Park (which is almost destroyed) Evil Toy Co. outlet and when they get there they see that Jimmy made some Mech-Suits that will let them fight the Big Tin Robots. After defeating a giant evil toy Jimmy head, they head back into the factory where they find some more master models.
Chad-Bot tells them that Saucer-Men toys capture heroes, so the Nicktoons go through the factory, collect the rest of the master models and destroy the Saucer-Men toys. Then, the Nicktoons head to Fairy World. They then free Jorgen (who was in a frozen state on till Patrick bumped into him thanks to Jimmy), who destroys the fairy harvester, and then get back into the Mech-Suits to the Professor's lair (Jorgen even tells them to collect 500 fairies which they do).
They get to where the opening intro of the game was and the winner of the Biggest Genius is none other than Chad-Bot himself, who tells Calamitous' plan to abduct the best characters from every universe lead to his victory. Chad-Bot credits SpongeBob, Danny, Patrick, Sam, Timmy, Jimmy, Jenny, Rocko, GIR, Stimpy and Tak for his rise to success, and the game ends with Chad-Bot cutting Calamitous' mustache off with an electric shaver as a prize.
","Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots gameplay includes playing as two Nicktoons in some levels and piloting an operational Mech suit (created by Jimmy Neutron) in others. Players journey through Bikini Bottom, Amity Park, the Ghost Zone (GBA version only), Fairy World, Pupununu Village (handheld version only), Retroville (handheld version only), and Calamitous' Lair (console version only), as well as the Toybot Factory, which is divided into multiple segments.

However, the Mawgu breaks the circle of summoning, scattering the nine heroes across the island. SpongeBob SquarePants and Danny Phantom end up right where the Wise Old Crab is. He tells them that he has summoned them here and tells them that the Mawgu has escaped from his prison and is seeking vengeance against the island. The Mawgu has created a terrible ooze corrupting everything and everyone that it touches. However, according to the crabs' legends, the ""Chosen Ones"" can rescue everyone from the Mawgu Ooze and defeat the Mawgu.
SpongeBob and Danny fight the Mawgu's minions, finding Timmy Turner, Danny's friends Sam Manson and Tucker and SpongeBob's friends Sandy Cheeks, Squidward Tentacles and Patrick Star. They find one of Jimmy Neutron's communication devices, learning that the Mawgu's interruption of the ceremony left Jimmy back in his lab. Jimmy also reveals that the Mawgu had created a rift in time and space above the volcano which is siphoning energy from Retroville, Bikini Bottom, Dimmsdale, and Amity Park, to power himself; if this continues for too long, it will suck up their worlds and destroy the multiverse.
Using Jimmy's blueprints, Tucker sends the rest of the heroes to collect parts for a Rift Zipper, to seal the rift and stop the Mawgu. Once completed, the eight heroes enter the volcano and travel up into the rift, where the Mawgu awaits them. Sam, Tucker, Sandy, Timmy and Patrick keep the Mawgu busy while Danny, SpongeBob and Squidward ascend, through using the debris sucked in from the other worlds to the rift's core. The device drains the Mawgu of his strength, allowing the closing rift to seal him away forever.
After being congratulated by the Wise Old Crab and the denizens of Volcano Island, the heroes then depart through a portal open by Jimmy, so he can send them back to their respective worlds.

Nicktoons: Freeze Frame FrenzyNA|SpongeBob SquarePants and Friends: Freeze Frame FrenzyPAL,,2004,Altron,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"In each level, the player has to meet a certain number of set points in order to progress. This is achieved by accomplishing the following missions:
The player does not necessarily have to accomplish all of these goals, but it is recommended that they focus mainly on photographing the misplaced characters; photographing and transporting these characters is worth 1000 points each, while everything else is worth 10. However, the player gets bonus points if they clear the other objectives in addition.
Throughout the levels, the player's camera can be damaged by mechanical bolts rolling about on the ground, however the character can take a picture of it to dispose of it. If the bolt reaches the player, the characters themselves do not take damage from these (but bounce back), but ironically enough, the camera will, and should its energy meter be completely drained, it will break and Jimmy Neutron will have to repair it while the player is given the option to continue. The player will also fail a level if they are unable to reach the required goal score for that level.
At the end of each world, the character will face off with a robot boss built to resemble another character. In order to defeat the boss, the player will need to take photos of it several times, stunning them on the first camera flash and then delivering a blow with another flash. During the boss battles, the bosses will fling mechanical bolts which cause as much damage as the ones in the regular levels. Before each boss battle, the player's character and the boss will engage in a conversation that is different depending on which character the player is using (for example, Timmy will remark to the Helga robot, ""Something tells me you'd make an even worse babysitter than Vicky!""); the conversation becomes a bit lengthier if the player uses a character from the same show as the character whom the robot's appearance is based on.

In each scenario, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, provide a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty. Gameplay is taken in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season, and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. The player may achieve victory through numerous means, among which are forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.
The player can make many choices during the campaign. According to Evan Brooks of Computer Gaming World: ""One may transfer soldiers between fiefs, go to war, increase taxes (which causes a decrease in peasant loyalty which may lead to rebellion), transfer rice or gold to another fief, raise the level of flood control (which decreases productivity), make a non-aggression pact or arrange a marriage, cultivate (which increases productivity, but decreases peasant loyalty), use a merchant (to buy/sell rice, borrow funds, or purchase weapons), recruit for the military (soldiers or ninja), train the army (which increases fighting efficiency), spy on a rival, expand a town (which increases taxes collected, but decreases peasant loyalty), give food/rice to peasants/soldiers (to raise morale), steal peasants from rival daimyos, allocate military strength, recuperate (even a daimyo can get sick), turn over a controlled fief to the computer for administration, or pass a turn.""[5]

Abe's chant possession ability (enabling the player to control NPCs) was also changed: in Munch's Oddysee, it appears as a small ball of energy which the player controls, and must be earned by the collection of the spherical 'spooceshrubs', which may also be used for opening some locked doors. Other new features include Abe's ability to pick up objects and people, and different vending machines, which supply new abilities for a brief moment. The most significant new feature is the ability to switch control between Abe and Munch. Munch has his own abilities, such as using his sonar to control the Snoozers from the control panel, as well as pick up grabbers. He can also swim in water, while Abe can not. In the game's booklet, it warns that Abe can only possess Industrialists, but in gameplay, the player can possess all the creatures permitted in Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, and, for the first time, Slogs (the reptilian hounds kept by the industrialists as guards), though the options for controlling non-Industrialists are very limited, and usually result in the victim's destruction.

Open Season,,2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","Boog (Chris Williams) is a 900-pound grizzly who is the star of the town Timberline's nature show. In a dream, Boog chases after a giant version of his teddy bear Dinkleman, but he is soon woken by Beth (Kari Wahlgren), who takes him to the town center for Boog's performance. But Beth finds that Shaw, a cruel hunter, has already hunted a buck. She goes into Sheriff Gordy's police office to confront Shaw. The buck (Matthew W. Taylor) wakes up and introduces himself, his name being Elliot. Boog reluctantly frees him, and Shaw (Darryl Kurylo) vows revenge on Boog after Sheriff Gordy (Carlos Alazraqui) tells him he's been living in the woods too long. That night, Elliot decides to ""free"" Boog in return. He manages to lure him to the convenience store, where they finish all the chocolate bars there, but they're discovered by the police and incapacitated with a tranquilizer gun by Beth and brought to the Timberline National Forest until the start of open season. There, Elliot claims that he knows how to get back to Timberline, prompting a road trip.
They encounter a squirrel called McSquizzy (Michael Gough) and his army of squirrels called the Furry Tail Clan (Carlos Alazraqui), who abuse them with nuts. Boog meets a few members of Elliot's herd: Giselle (Kari Wahlgren), a doe whom Elliot has a crush on, and Ian (Patrick Warburton), the head of the herd who hates Elliot. It's revealed that during this time of year, the Deer Games are held, with only one sport: Running. Elliot competes with Ian and wins the race, but he's kicked away by a jealous Ian as revenge. In the Timberline National Forest, Boog and Elliot help all kinds of animals with their tasks. The two meet McSquizzy again, who directs them to a shortcut: A mine. After riding through the mine in a minecart, Boog and Elliot continue their journey across a valley, and climb up a mountain, only to encounter Shaw, they escape the hunter by rolling down the hill in a big snow ball. They get to a beaver's dam, which Elliot claims is the way home. Not letting them cross, the two help the beavers find a missing piece for the dam: An outhouse. They find Boswell (Maurice LaMarche), trying to push the outhouse down from a hunting camp. Boog and Elliot jump onto it, and it quickly breaks and they ride it down the river rapids until they reach the dam. Boog quickly realizes that Elliot had never known how to go to Timberline because he'd asked some moles (since they're blind) for directions. Boog's weight causes the dam to break up. Having lost Elliot in the flood, Boog looks for shelter for the night. Boog enters Shaw's house, only to be confronted by Shaw himself. Shaw locks Boog in his basement but Boog eventually escapes, and encounters McSquizzy on a sign, who threatens to not show him the way back home if he doesn't help the animals during open season. Boog goes the right way, but he decides to go back and help the animals, suggesting to the wilds that they fight back.
Agreeing to this, Serge (Danny Mann), Deni, and the rest of the ducks fly around the Timberline National Forest, dropping propane tanks everywhere, while the other animals collect items helpful for the fight. The wilds ultimately win the battle against the hunters. But while they're celebrating, Shaw appears and tries to shoot Boog. Elliot sacrifices himself by jumping in front of Boog and takes the hit instead, seemingly killing him, which angers Boog. Boog defeats Shaw after throwing a skunk, a rabbit, and a squirrel at him, roars him, and then he ties Shaw up with his gun. The game then closes as Elliot awakens having survived the gunshot and the wilds celebrate their victory by mauling Shaw.
","The game's genre is action-adventure. Players can play as Boog and Elliot who can do many actions, Boog can throw skunks through a hunter's chimney to scare them, or looking for berries to heal himself by smelling them. Elliot can jump, sneak past hunters and can lure them to a trap by taunting them. Many skills can be upgraded to 3rd level. Players can also decide what to do with the hunter: Sneak up and scare him or run up and throw him. In the game, the player must do many tasks for the forest animals, and when players do the max tasks for that species, they become their companions, and let players throw them at hunters as well. When players beat the game, they can play the mini-games they unlocked in single and multiplayer.

Players navigate a series of homes searching for luxury items, controlling RJ, Verne, Hammy or Stella. Character voices are provided by soundalikes rather than the original actors who recorded the voices for the film (except Bucky, Spike and Quillo).
Two different kinds of attack can be employed, melee and ranged. Your arsenal includes golf clubs, sticks, baseball bats, plungers and other various items to use as improvised weapons. Ranged attacks consist of throwing boomerangs, frisbees and shooting golf balls, and these attacks can be charged up. There are also energy attacks, projectile weapons and objects to pick up and throw at enemies. The game has several pickup weapons, such as weapons that only opponents have (i.e., a trowel). There are also guns that can be picked up, such as a toy ball launcher, a freeze ray, a bubble shooter, or a lava blaster.
Players can jump or double jump. The game allows a second player to press a button on the second controller and join the game at any time, as well as pause the game and drop out. There are also plenty of obstacles and hazards to overcome, as well as objectives to complete and extras to collect. The game also has an array of hats, which when collected make a humorous sound and act as armor. These include a chef hat, a crown, a witch hat and a hockey helmet amongst others.
Several locations from the movie (and some that are not) appear to give a greater playing ground than the suburbs, the home base being the woods where all the loot is stored. Players can switch around between the four characters to give the storyline some slight twist, as each character says something different when a situation arises, to slightly alter the story.

After the obstacles have been moved, the player presses a button and the camera shifts to one of Hammy's friends from Over the Hedge, and the player takes the shot.[2] The game contains a challenge mode after courses have been completed which contains more obstacles and allows for less strokes, and features a more traditional miniature golf mode without obstacles.
The Nintendo DS version of Hammy Goes Nuts! is an action adventure game.[1] The game follows Hammy in his attempts to help Boris the Beaver create a dam; in order to get the materials for the dam, Hammy and his friends set elaborate traps to fool the pest control man in order to be able to steal his tools throughout the neighborhood.[1] The player must complete a series of fetch quests in order to get the required materials.

The final level of each world has a boss that Pac-Man must defeat in order to progress.[1] The player can choose which world to enter, although two of them are locked until the other four are completed.[1] Worlds also vary in themes, featuring pirate ships, factories, a circus, graveyards and outer space.[1]
Levels contain fruit that can be eaten for bonus points, alongside letters that spell out ""PACMAN"". Collecting all of these letters in a level will unlock a secret bonus stage.[1] Some levels require Pac-Man to retrieve a key to rescue one of his captive friends.[1] Galaxian flagships found in certain levels; these allow Pac-Man to access a 3D maze themed after the world he is in.[1] These mazes play similarly to the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, where Pac-Man will need to eat all the dots and avoid the ghosts. Completing these mazes will unlock them for replay from the main menu.[1] Most levels also contain Pac-Man's nemeses, the ghost gang, which can be defeated by consuming large Power Pellets and eating them.[1]
Pac-Man has two main moves, which can be used to defeat enemies and other objects: a butt-bounce that can shatter crates and crush enemies, and a rev-roll that allows him to propel up ramps or activate moving platforms.[1] Pac-Man has a health meter that allows him to sustain three hits before dying. He can find small fractions of health to replenish it in levels, as well as extra lives.[1] The player can find crates scattered around in levels, some of them giving Pac-Man access to new abilities, such as a metal suit allowing him to walk underwater.[1] Pac-Man can also interact with objects such as trampolines, doors and ramps, which can be used to solve puzzles to progress through the level.[1] At the main menu, the player can play a port of the original Pac-Man arcade game, which is the same version found in Namco Museum Vol. 1.[1][2]

Pac-Man World 2,Yes,2005,Full Fat,Namco,"NA, PAL","Hundreds of years ago, the evil ghost king Spooky terrorized Pac-Land and the Pac-People. To stop him, the Great Wizard Pac created a powerful potion to transform five ordinary fruit into magical Golden Fruit. The knight Sir Pac-A-Lot defeated Spooky in battle, and used the Golden Fruit to seal him under a tree in the center of Pac-Village.
In the present day, Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde sneak into Pac-Village at night to steal the Golden Fruit from the tree, unaware of its purpose. In doing so, they unwittingly release Spooky, who commands them to aid his plan to eliminate all Pac-People. The ghosts agree and each take one of the Golden Fruit. The next morning, Professor Pac informs Pac-Man of the trouble and asks him to retrieve the stolen Golden Fruit in order to save Pac-Land. Pac-Man travels throughout Pac-Land and across the ocean to Ghost Island, defeating the ghosts and retrieving the Golden Fruit along the way. Pac-Man eventually returns to Pac-Village, where he is ambushed by Spooky. The power of the Golden Fruit transforms Pac-Man into a new golden form, and he defeats Spooky once more, sealing him back beneath the tree. The residents of Pac-Village emerge to congratulate Pac-Man, while his dog Chomp Chomp overhears the ghosts planning to free Spooky again and chases them out of the village.
","Pac-Man World 2 is a 3D platforming game, where the player controls Pac-Man and must navigate him to the end of each level. Pac-Man has multiple abilities including the Rev Roll, which can be used to launch Pac-Man over long gaps; the Butt-Bounce, which can press switches and attack enemies from above; and a jumping Flip Kick to strike airborne enemies. Eating special Power Pellets will also give Pac-Man temporary power-ups, such as turning him to metal, shrinking him in size, or allowing him to eat ghost enemies. Pac-Man possesses a health bar with only three segments; if his health is depleted, the player will lose a life and be sent back to the previous checkpoint. Each level features Pac-Dots and fruit to collect, which will increase the player's score for the level. After completing any non-boss level, the player can choose to replay it in Time Trial mode, challenging the player to reach the end as quickly as possible. During the time trial, fruits and other collectibles in the level are replaced by clocks, which will temporarily stop the timer if collected. If Pac-Man loses a life during the time trial, he must restart the level from the beginning.
The game features 25 levels: the Pac-Village tutorial level, followed by six different themed areas with four levels each. The last level of each area features a boss battle with one or more of the primary ghost enemies, who must be defeated to advance. Most levels feature one of 15 collectible Galaxian flagships, which will allow Pac-Man to play a bonus maze level in the style of the classic Pac-Man games. Non-boss levels also feature collectible arcade tokens. Eight are hidden in each level, while bonus tokens can be earned by collecting all the fruit and Pac-Dots in a level and completing time trials. By collecting certain numbers of tokens, players can unlock emulated versions of older Pac-Man titles in the Pac-Village arcade, including Pac-Man, Pac-Attack, Pac-Mania, and Ms. Pac-Man.[2] Collecting tokens will also unlock a jukebox, which enables the player to listen to the game's soundtrack, and a concept art gallery. The Game Boy Advance version does not feature any unlockable emulations.
For the game's Japanese PlayStation 2 release, the difficulty was rebalanced and made simpler compared to the North American and European releases, with certain levels shortened and bosses' health reduced.

Paperboy / Rampage,,2005,DSI Games,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house. If the player loses all of their lives, or runs out of subscribers, the game ends.[citation needed]
The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way.  The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends.  The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.[6]
Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers.  Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers.  Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.[5]
The player scores points for each paper delivered successfully (either at a subscriber's doorstep or inside their mailbox, the latter of which awards more points), as well as breakage points by damaging the houses of non-subscribers.  A perfect delivery (all subscribers get their papers, and none of their houses are damaged) results in all the points being worth double for that day, and an extra subscriber is added.  At the end of each stage is a training course with various obstacles to throw papers at (which gives bonus points) and to jump over, and the player scores a bonus for finishing the course.  Crashing on the course ends the round, but does not cost the player a life.
When a player fails to deliver a paper to a house, or damages a subscriber's house by breaking their windows, the resident will cancel their subscription, and the house turns dark. The player can regain subscribers by getting a perfect delivery, which adds one extra subscriber. 
The paperboy can hold no more than ten papers at once, although refills can be found throughout the level. The papers can also be used to stun enemies (with the exception of cars).

Peter Pan: The Motion Picture Event,No,2003,Saffire,Atari SA,"NA, PAL","In 1904, in the nursery of the Darling household located in London, England, Wendy Darling tells stories of Peter Pan to her younger brothers John and Michael before their Aunt Millicent's arrival. Judging Wendy to be an ""almost"" full-grown woman, Aunt Millicent advises Mr. and Mrs. Darling that Wendy should be given her own bedroom. At school, Wendy is caught by her teacher, daydreaming with a drawing she made after supposedly seeing Peter in the night. The school sends a letter about this to Wendy's father at the bank. In an attempt to stop the messenger boy from delivering the letter with the help of the family's nurse dog Nana, Wendy embarrasses her father in front of his superiors. As punishment, Mr. Darling chains Nana outside and declares that it is time for Wendy to grow up and have a room of her own.
Peter visits the nursery looking for his shadow, which Nana had bitten off during his previous visit. He introduces himself to Wendy, who sews his shadow back on. Peter invites her and her brothers to Neverland where Wendy can tell stories to his gang of Lost Boys. They agree and are taught to fly using Tinker Bell's fairy dust. Nana breaks free from her chain and leads Mr. and Mrs. Darling back home from a party, but they arrive too late to stop the children flying away. Captain Hook and his crew are alerted to Peter's return and fire their cannons, knocking Wendy far away and causing Michael and John to fall towards the island. Jealous of Wendy's presence, Tinker Bell tricks the Lost Boys into shooting Wendy with arrows as she is falling from the sky. To their relief, Wendy survives as the arrow hits her acorn necklace. However, Peter banishes Tinker Bell and ends their friendship.
Wendy awakens and agrees to be the Lost Boys' mother. They lead her to their hideout, but realize her brothers are missing. Michael and John encounter the Native American princess Tiger Lily and all three are then captured by Hook and his crew, and taken to the Black Castle. Peter and Hook engage in a duel, but it is stopped when the ticking crocodile arrives and tries to eat Hook, allowing the children to all escape. After a celebration at the Native American camp, Peter shows Wendy the fairies' home and the two share a dance. Hook spies on the two and charms Tinker Bell, still hurt over her banishment. Peter becomes upset with Wendy after she tries to get him to express his feelings. He tells her to leave, refusing to believe that he can ever love and grow up. Tinker Bell leads Hook's men to Wendy's makeshift ""house"" and they carry Wendy to his ship. There, he tries to entice her to become a pirate, but sends a spy to follow her to the Lost Boys' underground hideout afterwards. Wendy persuades her brothers to return home and are joined by the Lost Boys. Later, she leaves an upset Peter a cup of ""medicine"".
Wendy exits the hideout only to be ambushed and captured by Hook's crew. Hook enters the hideout and poisons Peter's medicine. However, Tinker Bell intervenes, drinking the poison instead, and succumbs to it. Peter asserts his belief in fairies, which reaches out to residents of London, bringing Tinker Bell back to life. Peter and Tinker Bell save Wendy and the boys from walking the plank by the pirates and a battle soon breaks out. Hook uses fairy dust to fight Peter in a duel while flying and taunts him about Wendy abandoning him and forgetting all about him when she grows up. Weakened by those thoughts and unable to fight, Peter Pan is incapacitated. A kiss from Wendy revives Peter and he finally defeats Hook, who falls into the jaws of the crocodile.
With the ship covered in fairy dust, Peter flies Wendy and the boys back to London. Mr. and Mrs. Darling are overjoyed at the return of their children, and adopt the Lost Boys. Slightly, who got lost on the way to London and arrives at the house too late, is adopted by Aunt Millicent. Peter promises never to forget Wendy and to return some day before heading back to Neverland with Tinker Bell. Wendy, as the adult narrator, claims she never saw Peter again, but she continues to tell his story to her own children and grandchildren so that his legacy will last forever.

One particular group of researchers lands on and partly colonizes the alien planet Delia. However, sometime after their stay, an emergency transmission is sent from Delia to their security force orbiting the planet. The only clue they are given is a message regarding a hazardous leak. The planet's space fighters had become possessed by an unknown space squadron of alien bioships that appear out of nowhere and soon make themselves a hostile threat among the possessed fighters. The player assumes the role of Wink Baulfield (named Rick in the Game Boy Advance version), an ace pilot assigned to investigate the disaster and possibly discover what is invading Delia in the assignment Operation Climax in the experimental space fighter the A/144 Phalanx.
","The player's ship can switch to different three speed levels at any time, allowing the player to move fast to avoid enemies and obstacles entirely, or slow down to weave between enemy bullets. An unusual addition for a shooter at the time is the ability for the player's ship to take multiple hits before losing a life: the Phalanx had three hit points which could be restored by a certain power-up, which is important as health is persistent between levels. A variety of weapons can be picked up from items that certain enemies leave behind, and up to three can be stored at a time; further weapons replace the currently-equipped weapon when acquired. The player can switch between these weapons freely, and sacrifice a weapon to produce a ""smart bomb"" effect, freeing up the slot to grab another weapon without waste. The Extend was set at every 300,000 points. Difficulty can be adjusted between three levels in the options menu (unavailable during play), and primarily affects the number of bullets fired by enemies; a hidden ""Funny"" difficulty is available through the use of cheat codes, and escalates the game's difficulty dramatically.
L â Laser: Equips the ship with two stationary options, respectively above and below the ship, while changing the ship's attack to a piercing laser beam. Successive upgrades cause the options to fire beams as well, fore and aft, while increasing the beams' power. Its Smart Bomb attack causes the ship to spin rapidly, firing powerful bullets outward in a spiral pattern, while rendering the ship invulnerable.
H â Homing: Equips the ship with two options which orbit clockwise around the ship, while changing the ship's main weapon to a homing ball of energy. Upgrading causes the options to fire their own homing balls, and increases their power. Its Smart Bomb attack is a ball of energy that surrounds the ship, negating all damage and causing heavy damage to any enemy touched by the energy field.
E â Energizer: A charge weapon which fires energy bolts; charging increases the size and number of bolts fired; upgrades improve the maximum charge level. Its Smart Bomb attack is a full-screen antimatter reaction which causes continual damage to all visible enemies.
R â Ricochet: Equips the ship with two options which orbit the ship in opposing directions, while changing the ship's attack to a green ball of energy. Upgrading causes the options to fire similar balls of energy forward diagonally up and down, which bounce off flat walls or ceilings, and increases overall damage. Its Smart Bomb attack combines the two options into a single homing drone which engages enemies at melee range, killing them before seeking a new target. Unlike other Smart Bomb attacks, the ship remains vulnerable during this attack; additionally, the drone will frequently seek out invulnerable portions of enemies to attack, reducing its usefulness against bosses.
A â A-Type Missile: A standard side-weapon which launches homing missiles that detonate on impact.
B â B-Type Missile: A standard side-weapon which launches forward firing rockets that do not detonate, and damage all enemies along their path.

With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, Phoenix proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer.
Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office. Her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, a skilled prosecutor Phoenix knows from childhood. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. In gratitude, Maya becomes Phoenix's assistant.
His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in the Steel Samurai children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. It is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.
On Christmas Eve, Edgeworth is arrested for the murder of attorney Robert Hammond. After relenting for Phoenix's help after an initial refusal, Wright faces Edgeworth's mentor Manfred von Karma, who has not lost a single case in his forty-year career. Phoenix discovers that former bailiff Yanni Yogi shot Hammond while Von Karma provided Yogi with the gun. Years earlier, Edgeworth's father Gregory ruined Von Karma's spotless record when he convinced a judge to penalize Karma for misconduct. Unable to deal with such a blemish on his legacy, Karma murdered Gregory in cold blood, leaving Miles to believe he himself was responsible, while Yogi was publicly blamed and convinced by Hammond, his attorney, to fake insanity which got him acquitted of all charges, making the case unsolved till that very day. After Von Karma suffers a breakdown in court and confesses to the cover-up and for murdering Gregory, Edgeworth is set free. Following the trial, Phoenix explains that Edgeworth motivated him to become an attorney after he defended Phoenix from a false theft accusation as children. However, Edgeworth decided to become Von Karma's pupil following his father's murder after being motivated by his hatred of criminals. After the case, it was revealed that Larry was the true culprit of the theft. Nevertheless, Edgeworth decides to rethink whether or not he should resume his previous duties. Meanwhile, Maya decides to return to her home village to finish her spirit medium training.
In a fifth and final case added for the Nintendo DS and subsequent releases, Phoenix is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, the head of the prosecutor's office. Skye is accused of murdering detective Bruce Goodman, who was found in the trunk of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, when a serial killer named Joe Darke allegedly murdered prosecutor Neil Marshall while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, the Chief of Police, accidentally admits that he murdered Marshall and framed Ema for the crime in order to blackmail Lana into doing his bidding, and confesses to killing Goodman after he requested that the case be reopened. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.
","Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a visual novel adventure game[3] where the player takes the role of Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney, and attempts to defend their clients in five cases. These cases are played in a specific order. After finishing them, the player can re-play them in any order.[4] Each case begins with an opening cinematic cutscene showing a murder;[5] shortly thereafter, the player is given the job of defending the prime suspect in the case.[4] The gameplay is divided into two sections, investigations and courtroom trials.[6]
During investigations, which usually take place before or between trial sessions, the player gathers information and evidence by talking to characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police.[6] The player can move a cursor to examine various things in the environment.[7] By using a menu the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters.[6] By showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can access new information.[8]
In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides, and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests the player can use at crime scenes to find clues. The player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen allowing them to see otherwise invisible blood stains. They can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints.[9]  Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.[10]
During the courtroom trials, the player aims to prove their clients' innocence; to do so, they cross-examine witnesses.[6] During these cross-examinations, the player aims to uncover lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony. They are able to go back and forth between the different statements in the testimony and can press the witness for more details about a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement.[11] In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands.[6] In the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote.[12] At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Wright's claims.[6] A number of exclamation marks are shown on the screen; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of them disappears. If they all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart.[13] When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.[14]

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney â Justice for All|Gyakuten Saiban 2JP,,2002,Capcom,Capcom,JP,"In the game's first case, attorney Phoenix Wright is attacked with a fire extinguisher from behind after an anonymous individual calls him on a phone which was supposed to be used as evidence in the trial, resulting in a severe case of amnesia. The assailant is later shown to be Richard Wellington after an attempt to steal his phone back. With the help of his client, policewoman Maggey Byrde, he learns that he is representing her in a case where she faces charges of having murdered her boyfriend, a fellow officer named Dustin Prince on his birthday. After narrowly avoiding disaster due to his lack of preparation, Phoenix exposes Richard Wellington, a con artist testifying for the prosecution, as the true murderer, as well as Phoenix's attacker, saving Maggey.
The second case is set shortly before the first, in which Dr. Turner Grey, a private surgeon who lost his reputation due to alleged malpractice that resulted in the death of several patients, requests his help in contacting Maya Fey, Phoenix's former assistant who had left the practice to finish training as a spirit medium in her home village. While performing a spirit channeling on Grey's behalf, Maya apparently kills him under the influence of the channeled spirit. Forced to once again defend her in court, Phoenix learns that Franziska von Karma, the daughter of his old enemy Manfred von Karma, has assumed the role of High Prosecutor from Miles Edgeworth, who is presumed to have committed suicide. Teaming up with Maya and her young cousin Pearl, Phoenix uncovers a conspiracy between Mimi Miney, a disgruntled nurse who was the true culprit of the malpractice incident at Grey's clinic who faked her identity stating her name was âIni Mineyâ, Mimi's sister who was the victim of a car accident 1 year prior, and Maya's aunt and Pearl's mother Morgan Fey, who held a deep hatred of Maya's mother Misty Fey. The two plotted to kill Grey and frame Maya, ruining her chances of succeeding her mother as spiritual leader of her home village, and replace her as successor with Pearl. When Miney publicly confesses to the murder and her real identity, Morgan is sentenced to solitary confinement for her crimes, and Phoenix decides to take Pearl in as one of his assistants.
The third case focuses on circus magician Maximillion Galactica, who is accused of murdering his employer Russell Berry in a dispute. Despite Franziska's interference, Phoenix and his team prove that Acro, one of Max's fellow performers, framed him after mistakenly killing Russell, having intended to kill his daughter Regina in revenge for an incident that left his brother in a coma.
In the final case, Maya is kidnapped by assassin Shelly de Killer, who threatens to kill her if Phoenix does not win an acquittal for his client, actor Matt Engarde, who has been arrested for killing his rival, Juan Corrida. As a ""present"", de Killer stages an assassination attempt on Franziska by shooting her, rendering her unable to act as prosecutor. At the last second, Edgeworth arrives and steps in to replace her. With Phoenix resorting to increasingly desperate acts to prolong the trial, Edgeworth offers to help him save Maya, explaining that he has been leading a task force to capture de Killer. Using a tape that Engarde, in truth a thoroughly guilty psychopath, had recorded as blackmail, Phoenix reveals his betrayal to de Killer who then cancels his contract with Engarde, making him the next target. Fearing that de Killer will target and murder him, Engarde suffers a breakdown and pleads guilty and is convicted of Juanâs murder. As a reward for Phoenix's help, de Killer releases Maya, who subsequently reunites with Pearl and all of their friends.
Edgeworth explains that his absence was spent soul-searching for ""the answer"" as to what it means to be a prosecutor, and he and Phoenix reconcile, while Franziska pledges to renounce her profession in disgrace. Edgeworth confronts her at the airport, where Franziska breaks down in tears and admits that she is jealous of Edgeworth and wanted to destroy him, but now feels that she cannot with such huge losses on her record. Recognizing that she needs to find the same answers he did, she returns to her native Germany with a picture of Phoenix in her possession. There is also an alternate ending, where Engarde is declared innocent, and his manager is convicted in a later trial. Phoenix, convinced that he can no longer continue as an attorney, closes his firm and retires in disgrace.
","Justice for All is a visual novel adventure game[4] in which the player takes the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney who defends people accused of murder in four different episodes.[5] At first, only one episode is available; as the player solves a case, a new episode is unlocked to play. The episodes are all divided into chapters, consisting of courtroom sections and investigation sections.[6]
During the investigation sections, the player investigates the case to gather evidence needed for the trial; once enough evidence has been collected, the game moves on to the next chapter of the episode. During these sections, the player has access to a menu with four options: examine, move, present, and talk. By choosing ""examine"", the player can move a cursor around the screen and look at various things in the environment; by choosing ""move"", the player reaches a sub-menu with all locations they can choose to move to; by choosing ""present"", the player can choose to show a piece of evidence or a character profile to a character at the location; and by choosing ""talk"", the player is able to pick a topic to discuss with a character who is present at the location. As the player talks to a character, the topics they have already discussed get marked with a checkmark.[7]
If the player chooses a topic the witnesses does not want to discuss, the player is shown locks and chains on top of the character, referred to as ""psyche-locks""; additionally, a lock symbol is added to that topic in the talk menu. By presenting a magatama to the character, the player is able to start breaking the psyche-locks and unlock the topics; this is done by showing the character evidence or character profiles that proves they are hiding something. The deeper the secret is that the character is hiding, the more psyche-locks appear; by breaking all the locks, the topic gets unlocked and the player is given access to new information.[3][8]
During the courtroom sections, the player attempts to get the defendant the correct verdict by questioning witnesses and presenting evidence to the judge and the prosecutor. Many witnesses lie or make errors during their testimonies; the player is able to move back and forth through the testimony to try to find any inconsistencies. There are two options available during cross-examinations: ""press"", which makes the player question a particular statement, which sometimes makes the witnesses change their testimony; and ""present"", which is used to show a piece of evidence or a character profile that the player thinks shows a contradiction in the witness's currently shown statement.[9] In the upper right corner of the screen, the player's health bar is shown, representing the judge's patience. The bar decreases if the player makes mistakes, such as presenting the wrong piece of evidence; if it reaches zero, the defendant is declared guilty, and the player loses the game. While the player cannot lose the game while trying to break a psyche-lock, the bar will still decrease if the player presents the wrong evidence while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the bar is restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and 100% is restored when an episode is completed.[10]

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney â Trials and Tribulations|Gyakuten Saiban 3JP,,2004,Capcom,Capcom,JP,"Similar to previous games, Trials and Tribulations focuses on the careers of defense attorneys Phoenix Wright and Mia Fey. Other featured characters include Maya Fey, Mia's sister and a spirit medium who acts as Phoenix's secretary and assistant, and her young cousin Pearl Fey. After Mia was killed during the events of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney; Phoenix took over her law practice. Nevertheless, he regularly consults with her on cases by having either Maya or Pearl channel her spirit, which allows them to assume her appearance. Phoenix also occasionally receives help from prosecutors Miles Edgeworth and Franziska von Karma, who both hold him in high regard. The game's featured antagonist is Godot, an eccentric, coffee-loving prosecutor who keeps his identity concealed behind a mask and who seems to harbor a personal grudge against Phoenix.
Five years before the game's events, university student Phoenix Wright is charged with the murder of his classmate Doug Swallow. Mia, acting as his lawyer, exposes prosecution witness Dahlia Hawthorne, Phoenix's girlfriend, as the real murderer, revealing she used Phoenix to hide evidence tying her to the poisoning of Mia's former partner Diego Armando, planning to kill him as well. For her efforts, Dahlia is arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death. Out of gratitude, Phoenix tells Mia that her defense of him inspired him to switch majors and to study to become an attorney.
In the present, Phoenix, representing thief Ron DeLite in court, faces off against prosecutor Godot. Although Phoenix is able to get Ron acquitted, Ron is subsequently arrested for the murder of his former boss Kane Bullard, based on evidence Phoenix presented in his defense. At the last second, Phoenix manages to identify corrupt private investigator Luke Atmey as the true culprit, having realized Atmey framed Ron so he could use double jeopardy to escape punishment.
Months later, Phoenix is informed he supposedly failed to properly defend former client Maggey Byrde against accusations of poisoning programmer Glen Elg. Realizing someone impersonated him, Phoenix secures a retrial and conducts his own investigation, discovering that Elg was developing a computer virus on behalf of loan shark Furio Tigre. He deduces Tigre killed Elg to steal the virus, needing money to repay a large debt, before framing Maggey and posing as Wright to ensure her conviction. Despite no conclusive evidence, Phoenix manages to get Tigre arrested by tricking him into saying something only the real killer would've known.
The fourth case depicts Mia's first case six years earlier, in which she and Armando defend death row inmate Terry Fawles, who was under suspicion of murdering policewoman Valerie Hawthorne during an escape attempt. Mia's persistence pays off when she learns the truth: years earlier, Terry, Valerie, and her younger sister Dahlia staged a kidnapping to steal a jewel from their family. Dahlia then faked her death, leaving Terry to be convicted of murder based on Valerie's testimony. Terry had escaped in the hopes of learning the truth, but unbeknownst to him, Dahlia had already killed Valerie and planted her body in his car. Before a judgement can be passed, Terry dies from poison slipped to him by Dahlia, forcing a mistrial and freeing Dahlia. She subsequently poisons Armando after learning he was investigating her further, leading to Phoenix gaining the bottle, ensuring that they would both cross paths with Mia.
In the fifth and final case, Phoenix is visiting a mountain retreat with Maya and Pearl when fellow guest Elise Deauxnim is murdered. While looking for Maya, he falls into a river and becomes ill, forcing Edgeworth and Franziska to temporarily fill in as attorney and prosecutor to keep his client, a nun named Iris, from being found guilty. When Phoenix returns, he explains Elise was really Maya's long-lost mother, Misty Fey, and that her death was the result of a plan engineered by her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the now-executed Dahlia, who turns out to be Iris' twin. Through cross-examination, Phoenix reveals that not only is Dahlia impersonating Iris, but she is also using Maya's body to do so. With Mia's help, Dahlia is exorcised from Maya and the real Iris is declared innocent. Godot is revealed as the one responsible for killing Misty to protect Maya from Dahlia, leading to the discovery of his true identity: Diego Armando. Having spent his time since awakening from his coma blaming Phoenix for Mia's death and seeking revenge, he concedes that Phoenix has done more to continue her legacy than him. Iris is also arrested as Diego's accomplice, but reveals to Phoenix that it was her he dated in college, as she posed as Dahlia to protect him from her sister before eventually falling in love with him. Reuniting with his friends, Phoenix celebrates finally being free of his past.
","Trials and Tribulations is a visual novel adventure game[3] in which the player takes the roles of Phoenix Wright and Mia Fey, defense attorneys who defend their clients in five different episodes.[4][5] The gameplay remains unchanged from Justice for All, the previous title in the series.[4][6]
From the start, only one episode is available to play; when the player completes an episode, a new one is unlocked. The episodes are divided into chapters, which consist of investigations and courtroom sessions.[7] During investigation sections, the player aims to find evidence for use in the courtroom sessions; the game moves on to the next chapter within the episode when the player has gathered enough evidence. The player moves and performs actions through a menu with four options: ""examine"", which lets them move a cursor over the environment and examine items; ""move"", which shows a menu with locations the player can move to; talk, which shows a list of topics the player can discuss with witnesses in the area; and present, which lets the player show evidence or character profiles to a witness.[8] Some witnesses do not want to discuss certain subjects, leading to a lock symbol appearing over the subject. By showing the witness a magatama, the player is able to see the secret they are trying to hide in the form of locks, called a ""Psyche-Lock""; by presenting correct evidence or character profiles, the player can break the locks and be able to discuss the subject.[9]
During the courtroom sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can move back and forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony.[10] A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.[11]

Prior to starting a new playthrough, players have the choice to change various settings at the options screen such as controls and difficulty.[1][2][3][4]
Most of the stages featured in the game, though linear in nature, are large and populated with multiple obstacles, enemies and environmental hazards, requiring the player to traverse the stage by running, jumping, climbing, swinging, shooting or dodging enemies while other areas that are featured later become more maze-like and exploratory, making the player take different routes to reach the end and on certain stages, a boss must be fought in order to progress further.

Play Novel: Silent Hill,No,"20010320010321March 21, 2001Â (JP)",,Konami,JP,"Silent Hill opens with Harry Mason's drive to the titular town with his adopted daughter Cheryl for a vacation. At the town's edge, he swerves to avoid hitting a girl in the road, and as a result, he crashes and loses consciousness.[5] Waking up in town, he realizes that Cheryl is missing and sets out to look for her. The town is deserted and foggy, with snow falling out of season, and he begins to experience bouts of unconsciousness and encounters with hostile creatures. During his exploration of the town, he meets Cybil Bennett, a police officer from the neighboring town who is investigating the mysterious occurrences. Dahlia Gillespie, a cultist, gifts him the Flauros, a charm which she claims can counteract the darkness spreading through the town. In the town's hospital, he encounters its director, Dr. Michael Kaufmann, bewildered by the sudden changes in the town, and discovers a frightened, amnesiac nurse, Lisa Garland, hiding in one of the rooms.[7][8][9][10]
Harry can later rescue Kaufmann from a monster, discover evidence of Kaufmann's role in the local drug trafficking, and stumble upon Kaufmann's hidden bottle of aglaophotis, a supernatural liquid that can exorcise demons.[11] Harry comes to believe that a darkness is transforming the town into someone's nightmare, which is why the inhabitants have mostly disappeared. Dahlia urges him to stop ""the demon"" responsible for itâthe girl in the road who appears to him sporadicallyâor Cheryl will die.[12] Continuing his search, Harry finds himself drawn into a fight with Cybil, who has become the host to a supernatural parasite; the player can choose to save her.[13] The next time Harry sees the girl, the Flauros activates and neutralizes her telekinetic powers. Dahlia then appears and reveals that she manipulated Harry into catching the girlâan apparition of her daughter, Alessa.
Harry then awakens in the hospital again, next to Lisa. Lisa explains that she experienced a sense of deja vu while in the basement, and when he finds her again, she despairs that she is ""the same as them"". She pleads with Harry to save her, and blood runs down her face; horrified, he flees. Her diary reveals that she nursed Alessa during a secret, forced hospitalization. Alessa's never-healing wounds terrified her, as she fell deeper into a drug addiction fueled by Kaufmann.[14] Finding Dahlia with Alessa's defeated apparition and charred body, Harry demands to know Cheryl's whereabouts: he discovers that seven years earlier, Dahlia conducted a ritual to force Alessa to birth the cult's deity; Alessa survived being immolated because her status as vessel rendered her immortal, while her mental resistance to the ritual caused her soul to be bisected, preventing the birth. One half manifested as the infant Cheryl, whom Harry and his wife adopted. Dahlia then casts a spell to lure Cheryl back, while Alessa was imprisoned within the hospital, enduring unceasing agony as a result of her injuries. With Alessa's plan thwarted and her soul rejoined, the deity is revived and possesses her.[15][16]
Four different endings are available, dependent on the player's previous actions. In the ""Bad"" ending, the deity merges with Alessa and electrocutes Dahlia before attacking Harry. He defeats it, and Cheryl's voice thanks him for freeing her. Overcome by grief, Harry collapses, and the next scene is that of his corpse in his wrecked car. The ""Bad +"" ending concludes with Harry and Cybil fleeing instead after the deity's demise. In the ""Good"" ending, Kaufmann, now feeling betrayed by Dahlia, demands that she restore the town to normal and uses aglaophotis to exorcise the deity out of Alessa. Harry defeats the deity, and Alessa gives him an infant, the reincarnation of herself and Cheryl. She then helps him escape from her nightmare realm. In the ""Good +"" ending, Harry escapes with Cybil and the baby. In both ""Good"" endings, a bloody and vengeful Lisa prevents Kaufmann from escaping with Harry.[13] The joke ending features extraterrestrials abducting Harry.[17]
","The objective of the player is to guide main protagonist and player character Harry Mason through a monster-filled town as he searches for his lost daughter, Cheryl. Silent Hill's gameplay consists of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving.[3] The game uses a third-person view, with the camera occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect, in pre-scripted areas. This is a change from older survival horror games, which constantly shifted through a variety of camera angles. Because Silent Hill has no heads-up display, the player must consult a separate menu to check Harry's ""health"".[4] If a DualShock controller is used, a heart beat rhythm can be felt signifying that the player is at low health.
Harry confronts monsters in each area with both melee weapons and firearms. An ordinary man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting.[2] His inexperience in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady.[5] A portable radio collected early in the game alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with bursts of static.[2]

The player can locate and collect maps of each area, stylistically similar to tourist maps. Accessible from the menu and readable only when sufficient light is present, each map is marked with places of interest. Visibility is mostly low due to fog[3] and darkness; the latter is prevalent in the ""Otherworld"".[6] The player locates a pocket-size flashlight early in the game, but the light beam illuminates only a few feet.[2] Navigating through Silent Hill requires the player to find keys and solve puzzles.[3] "

PokÃ©mon Emerald,,2004,Game Freak Creatures Inc.,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL",NaN,"The gameplay in Emerald is largely the same as in Ruby and Sapphire. Much of the game takes place in an overhead style; players' characters can move in four directions and can talk to other people on the overworld. Players can encounter wild PokÃ©mon by walking into grass, surfing on their PokÃ©mon, walking through caves, and other means. They can also battle other trainers' PokÃ©mon. When this happens, the game shifts to a battle screen where players and their PokÃ©mon are seen on the front-left portion of the screen while opponents are viewed on the back-right portion. Stats of the PokÃ©mon and their trainers are shown on the side of each participant; these stats include the PokÃ©mon's levels, each trainers' number of PokÃ©mon (from one to six), the PokÃ©mon's health, and any status effects, such as poison, paralysis or burn. Trainers send out the first PokÃ©mon in their party and they take turns attacking where the first strike is determined usually by the speed of the two PokÃ©mon. Players can choose from one of four options: Fight, Bag, Switch, and Run. Each PokÃ©mon has up to four moves that they can use, which have different effects, number of uses, and types, such as Grass or Psychic. When a PokÃ©mon hits 0 hit points (HP), they faint, forcing the PokÃ©mon's trainer to switch out. Once one trainer runs out of PokÃ©mon, the battle is over. When a human-controlled PokÃ©mon wins a battle, the PokÃ©mon gains experience. Enough experience will earn that PokÃ©mon a higher level, which grants upgraded statsâattack, defense, special attack, special defense, HP, and speedâand sometimes grant new moves.
Certain battles allow for two-on-two battles; certain moves were designed to support partners while other moves are capable of attacking two or more PokÃ©mon. Unlike Ruby and Sapphire which had the player fight two specific trainers, Emerald allowed for the player to have a 2-on-2 battle with two trainers both of whom they could usually battle separately. Every PokÃ©mon has an ability that often aides in battle, such as abilities that make a PokÃ©mon more powerful if they are close to fainting. Wild PokÃ©mon encountered by players can be captured using items called PokÃ© Balls, which have a greater chance of success the weaker the wild PokÃ©mon is. Players can battle and trade with others using any of the third generation PokÃ©mon games including Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, and LeafGreen by linking their Game Boy Advance systems together. This can be accomplished either by using a Game Boy Advance Link Cable or by use of the wireless adapter that was bundled with FireRed and LeafGreen. It is also compatible with PokÃ©mon XD: Gale of Darkness. This allows players to trade for PokÃ©mon not normally obtainable in Emerald.[1][2]
Aside from the traditional battle and overworld style, players' PokÃ©mon are also able to participate in PokÃ©mon Contests where they can try and win in five contest categories: ""Cool"", ""Beauty"", ""Cute"", ""Smart"", and ""Tough"" competitions. The players' characters are given a device early on called the PokÃ©Nav, which allows players to view the world map, check their PokÃ©mon's contest stats, and make and receive phone calls with trainers that they have met with whom they can chat or plan a battle. This replaces a function called ""Trainer's Eyes"", which allows players to register certain trainers and see when they are in the mood to battle. This also allows players to rebattle Gym Leaders, an ability not found in previous PokÃ©mon games. Emerald includes several other new features and changes such as animations of PokÃ©mon in-battle and an area called the Battle Frontier which is an expansion of the Battle Tower found in previous games. A man whom players encounter several times throughout the game will eventually allow them to access the Battle Frontier after beating the PokÃ©mon League Champion. The Battle Frontier features the aforementioned Battle Tower in addition to six new areas. Completing these areas awards players with ""Battle Points"" which can be spent on prizes to use in and out of battle. The Japanese version features compatibility with the Nintendo e-Reader; however, this was cut for the English release due to its lack of success. Also featured is the Trainer Hill area which, in the Japanese version, is compatible with the e-Reader.[citation needed][3] Rare PokÃ©mon that originated from earlier PokÃ©mon games such as Mew, Lugia, and Ho-Oh were made available through an in-game event.[4][citation needed]

PokÃ©mon FireRed,Yes,2004,Game Freak,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL, AUS","PokÃ©mon FireRed and LeafGreen takes place mostly in the fictional region of Kanto. This is one distinct region of many in the PokÃ©mon world, which includes varied geographical habitats for the PokÃ©mon species, human-populated towns and cities, and routes between locations. Some areas are only accessible once players acquire a special item or one of their PokÃ©mon learns a special ability.[11] Near the end of the plot, the protagonist is able to venture to the Sevii Islands, a new area not present in the original Red and Blue games. The Sevii Islands are an archipelago of seven islands and contain PokÃ©mon normally exclusive to the Johto region, as well as several post-game missions. After the aforementioned missions on the Sevii Islands are completed, the ability to trade with Ruby and Sapphire for Hoenn-exclusive PokÃ©mon becomes available.
The silent protagonist of FireRed and LeafGreen is a child who lives in a small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Oak, a famous PokÃ©mon researcher, explains to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild PokÃ©mon, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where they meet Oak's grandson, another aspiring PokÃ©mon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter PokÃ©mon for their travels. The rival then challenges them to a PokÃ©mon battle with their newly obtained PokÃ©mon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.
After reaching the next city, the player is asked to deliver a parcel to Professor Oak. Upon returning to the laboratory, they are presented with a PokÃ©dex, a high-tech encyclopedia that records the entries of any PokÃ©mon that are captured.[12] Oak then asks the player to fulfill his dream of compiling a comprehensive list of every PokÃ©mon in the game.
While visiting the region's cities, the player encounters special establishments called PokÃ©mon Gyms. Inside these buildings are Gym Leaders, each of whom the player must defeat in a PokÃ©mon battle to obtain a Gym Badge.[13] Once a total of eight badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the PokÃ©mon League, which consists of the best PokÃ©mon trainers in the region. There the player battles the Elite Four. Also throughout the game, the player has to fight against the forces of Team Rocket, a criminal organization that abuses PokÃ©mon. They devise numerous plans to steal rare PokÃ©mon, all of which the player must foil, meeting and defeating the organization boss Giovanni.
After the first time players defeat the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with them. Once more, the protagonist must thwart Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, and put them in the main computer at One Island. After that, the player can trade with Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum and XD.
","As with all PokÃ©mon role-playing games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in a third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, in which the player navigates the protagonist.[3] Here, a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure his or her PokÃ©mon, items, and gameplay settings.[4] When the player encounters a wild PokÃ©mon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player's PokÃ©mon and the engaged PokÃ©mon. During a battle, the player may select a move for their PokÃ©mon to perform, use an item, switch their active PokÃ©mon, or attempt to flee. All PokÃ©mon have hit points (HP); when a PokÃ©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an opponents PokÃ©mon faints, all of the player's PokÃ©mon involved in the battle receive a certain amount of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a PokÃ©mon will level up.[5]
Capturing PokÃ©mon is another essential element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild PokÃ©mon, the player may throw a PokÃ© Ball at it. If the PokÃ©mon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target PokÃ©mon and the type of PokÃ© Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the PokÃ© Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.[6]

The games support the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable, through which connected players may trade or battle.[8] Players may also connect with PokÃ©mon Ruby and Sapphire, as well as with PokÃ©mon Colosseum, allowing them to obtain over 350 PokÃ©mon.[9] FireRed and LeafGreen also have the ability to connect to the GameCube and interact with PokÃ©mon Box: Ruby and Sapphire. In PokÃ©mon Box, the player may organize and view their collected PokÃ©mon, and in Colosseum, PokÃ©mon may be used in battle.[10] FireRed and LeafGreen are also the first games in the series to be compatible with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which comes prepackaged with the games.[9] The adapter can be plugged into the link port of the Game Boy Advance system and allows players within a radius of 30â50 feet (9.1â15.2Â m) to wirelessly interact with each other.[7] In addition, as many as 30Â players at a time may join a special location called the ""Union Room"", where they can trade, battle, or chat.[9] Nintendo set up ""JoySpots"" at Japanese retail locations for this purpose.[7]

PokÃ©mon LeafGreen,Yes,2004,Game Freak,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL, AUS","PokÃ©mon FireRed and LeafGreen takes place mostly in the fictional region of Kanto. This is one distinct region of many in the PokÃ©mon world, which includes varied geographical habitats for the PokÃ©mon species, human-populated towns and cities, and routes between locations. Some areas are only accessible once players acquire a special item or one of their PokÃ©mon learns a special ability.[11] Near the end of the plot, the protagonist is able to venture to the Sevii Islands, a new area not present in the original Red and Blue games. The Sevii Islands are an archipelago of seven islands and contain PokÃ©mon normally exclusive to the Johto region, as well as several post-game missions. After the aforementioned missions on the Sevii Islands are completed, the ability to trade with Ruby and Sapphire for Hoenn-exclusive PokÃ©mon becomes available.
The silent protagonist of FireRed and LeafGreen is a child who lives in a small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Oak, a famous PokÃ©mon researcher, explains to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild PokÃ©mon, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where they meet Oak's grandson, another aspiring PokÃ©mon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter PokÃ©mon for their travels. The rival then challenges them to a PokÃ©mon battle with their newly obtained PokÃ©mon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.
After reaching the next city, the player is asked to deliver a parcel to Professor Oak. Upon returning to the laboratory, they are presented with a PokÃ©dex, a high-tech encyclopedia that records the entries of any PokÃ©mon that are captured.[12] Oak then asks the player to fulfill his dream of compiling a comprehensive list of every PokÃ©mon in the game.
While visiting the region's cities, the player encounters special establishments called PokÃ©mon Gyms. Inside these buildings are Gym Leaders, each of whom the player must defeat in a PokÃ©mon battle to obtain a Gym Badge.[13] Once a total of eight badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the PokÃ©mon League, which consists of the best PokÃ©mon trainers in the region. There the player battles the Elite Four. Also throughout the game, the player has to fight against the forces of Team Rocket, a criminal organization that abuses PokÃ©mon. They devise numerous plans to steal rare PokÃ©mon, all of which the player must foil, meeting and defeating the organization boss Giovanni.
After the first time players defeat the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with them. Once more, the protagonist must thwart Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, and put them in the main computer at One Island. After that, the player can trade with Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum and XD.
","As with all PokÃ©mon role-playing games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in a third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, in which the player navigates the protagonist.[3] Here, a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure his or her PokÃ©mon, items, and gameplay settings.[4] When the player encounters a wild PokÃ©mon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player's PokÃ©mon and the engaged PokÃ©mon. During a battle, the player may select a move for their PokÃ©mon to perform, use an item, switch their active PokÃ©mon, or attempt to flee. All PokÃ©mon have hit points (HP); when a PokÃ©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an opponents PokÃ©mon faints, all of the player's PokÃ©mon involved in the battle receive a certain amount of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a PokÃ©mon will level up.[5]
Capturing PokÃ©mon is another essential element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild PokÃ©mon, the player may throw a PokÃ© Ball at it. If the PokÃ©mon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target PokÃ©mon and the type of PokÃ© Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the PokÃ© Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.[6]
While FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of Red and Green (PokÃ©mon Green was only released in Japan, whereas the international variant was Blue), they contain usability enhancements such as a contextual tutorial feature which allows players to look up data at any point in the game. Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, aiding in remembering what they were previously doing.[7]

PokÃ©mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team|PokÃ©mon Fushigi no Danjon Aka no KyÅ«jotaiJP,,2005,Chunsoft,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL, AUS, KOR","The player wakes up one day finding that they have been transformed into a PokÃ©mon,[1] without any memory of their past. In a world devastated by many natural disasters â that have only begun to happen quite recently â [1] the player and a newly made friend join forces and form a rescue team. The team meets other rescue teams, including a top-ranked rescue team consisting of Alakazam, Charizard, and Tyranitar, named Team ACT. The team makes enemies unwittingly with another rescue team, Team Meanies, consisting of Gengar, Ekans, and Medicham, who seek world domination under the disguise of a rescue team. Not far into the storyline, the player is told of a legend about a Ninetales laying a curse on a human who had deliberately grabbed Ninetales' tail. Ninetales predicted that the human would eventually be reborn as a PokÃ©mon, and that the natural balance of the world would be upset. In the quest to discover the player's lost memory and purpose as a PokÃ©mon, the team journeys to where the fortune-teller Xatu resides. Xatu is quick to realize that the player was once a human and tells that the player's human-to-PokÃ©mon transformation is tied together with the natural disasters. This conversation is eavesdropped upon by Team Meanies' Gengar, who reveals the player's secret to the townsfolk and says that eliminating the human-turned-PokÃ©mon in the legend would return the world to normal.
They are confronted by Alakazam, who says the PokÃ©mon held a town meeting on what they must do to save the world: they must find and kill the player and anyone who sides with them. As they give the team one night to get away, the two leave PokÃ©mon Square as fugitives and make their way to the northeasternmost part of the world in an effort to elude the teams that are now hunting them down. Along the way, they encounter the legendary birds Moltres and Articuno, who feel the effects of the disasters in their respective areas. They befriend an Absol who seeks to find the true cause of the natural disasters. The trio reaches the top of Mt. Freeze only to be cornered by Team ACT. They get ready to finish the player and partner off, but are stopped by Ninetales, who reveals that the player is not the human in the legend, that both parts of the legend are coincidental occurrences, and that the world is in greater danger caused by the awakening of Groudon. Team ACT proceeds to try and stop Groudon, while the team heads home to clear all remaining suspicion at PokÃ©mon Square. After a few days, the player and the partner worry, as Team ACT has not come back from their mission to quell Groudon. Asking to rescue the missing Team ACT, Lombre refuses to let them go, saying there are plenty of tougher PokÃ©mon than them. Shiftry convinces three of the strongest PokÃ©mon, Blastoise, Octillery, and Golem, to form a special rescue team and rescue Team ACT. After a few days, the special team returns defeated.
After being discouraged by Gengar, the player and partner are able to get everyone's spirits back up, and volunteer to rescue Team ACT themselves. When the team reaches Magma Cavern, they find Charizard and Tyranitar defeated, with Alakazam fighting against Groudon alone before quickly being defeated. The team takes matters into their own hands and defeat Groudon. They return to town as heroes, but their celebration is short-lived as grave news arrives from Xatu. A huge meteor, revealed to be the true cause of the natural disasters, is heading for the world, threatening to destroy it. The only way to stop it is to ask for help from the sky guardian Rayquaza. It is less than cooperative, but after a battle, Rayquaza agrees to use its Hyper Beam to destroy the meteor. The team reawakens on the ground, surrounded by their supporters, where they find that the world is safe once again. However, the player must return to being a human and leave the PokÃ©mon world behind. After the credits roll, the player returns to the rescue team base in PokÃ©mon form and surprises everybody.
As time passes, many more secrets are revealed. A shard of the destroyed meteor opens a secret cave under Whiscash Pond, enabling evolution. It is later revealed that another shard hit Latias' wing, and the team rescues her at Pitfall Valley. It is eventually discovered that Gengar was the human from the legend; after uncomfortably getting the player's assistance, he manages to remove the part of the curse that affected his old partner Gardevoir.
","The player starts out as a human who turned into a PokÃ©mon, which can be one of sixteen PokÃ©mon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu, Meowth, Psyduck, Machop, Cubone, Eevee, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip and Skitty) and is determined by a personality quiz taken at the beginning of the game.[1] The player chooses a partner PokÃ©mon which is one of ten PokÃ©mon (which excludes the last six stated above and the PokÃ©mon of the same type).[1] The game is mission-based with many jobs, which can be found on the bulletin board, requested by mail, or initiated through story events, and include rescuing PokÃ©mon, delivering items, and escorting clients.[1] If the player successfully completes a job, they receive a reward, and Rescue Points, which increase a team's rank.[1]
These jobs take part in dungeons, of which the layout is randomized.[1] The objective is to either finish a job, or go through all the floors to find the exit.[1] In the dungeon, there are wild PokÃ©mon that battle with the player's team.[1] These battles are turn-based, and take place in the dungeon map.[1] PokÃ©mon fight using the four moves they know, by using a standard 'A button' attack,[1] or using projectiles and other items.[2] While going through the dungeon, the player gets hungry and has to eat food, either found in the dungeon or bought in advance.[1]
The player will fail if the main character is defeated. Before the credits, the player will also fail if the partner is defeated. However, supplementary allies (including the partner, after the credits) can be lost, at which point they will return to the base.

PokÃ©mon Pinball: Ruby and Sapphire,,2003,Jupiter,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"PokÃ©mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire plays similarly to traditional pinball games, using a similar engine to its predecessor, PokÃ©mon Pinball.[5] It features two boards, each themed on either PokÃ©mon Ruby or Sapphire. They have similar layouts, though they feature some differences, the Sapphire table being noted as slightly more annoying due to its setup.[6] The player launches a ball onto the board, at which point it descends towards the bottom of said board. The objective is to ensure that the ball is not lost via the drain. Players must utilize a pair of flippers located right above the drain to hit the ball upward, keeping it from falling for as long as possible. There are two outlanes located on either end of the board where the ball may fall, rendering players helpless. A Pikachu sits at either side of the board, and if players have filled its meter, it serves as a kickback, shooting the ball out of this outlane. The player can also shoot the ball into a mart, from which a power-up can be purchased to cause a Pichu will appear, allowing both outlanes to be blocked. This can assist the player in activating the four circles that sit in both the side slots and flipper paths, shown here spelling out the word âholeâ. Consequently, a gravity field appears in the central hole that starts a minigame which resembles a slot machine. In the blue field the player is able to utilize a Zigzagoon (shown here on the right side of the board) so that it can pounce on the selected tile and obtain the result.
After finishing the Rayquaza bonus stage, a new Start Slot tile appears, which is simply labeled ""Arrival"", signifying the arrival of a Jirachi. Activating this tile results in a bonus mode similar to Catch 'Em Mode, where the player only has thirty seconds to catch Jirachi. This is the only way to add Jirachi to the PokÃ©dex.
As players hit various objects around the field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball falls through the drain, that round is over.  The player's scores are tallied, and the player receives bonuses for their achievements. The game features a Ball Saver, which returns the ball to the launcher if it is lost in the drain within the first moments of the round. The Ball Saver icons are Legendary Pokemon Latias and Latios, which are illuminated while Ball Saver is still active. The aforementioned mart can provide boosts for players, one such that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective of the game is to complete the PokÃ©dex, similar to other PokÃ©mon titles.  There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.
In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must reveal a silhouette of a PokÃ©mon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the PokÃ©mon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby PokÃ©mon roam around the board as opposed to standard PokÃ©mon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their PokÃ©mon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the PokÃ©mon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of PokÃ©mon not found in the current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare PokÃ©mon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the PokÃ©mon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.

PokÃ©mon Ruby,,2002,Game Freak,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL, AUS","PokÃ©mon Ruby and Sapphire take place in the Hoenn region, located some distance from the Kanto and Johto regions featured in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90Â° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance.[13] Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.
Like other PokÃ©mon games, Ruby and Sapphire's gameplay is linear; the main events occur in a fixed order.[14] The protagonist of PokÃ©mon Ruby and Sapphire is a child who has recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to protect Professor Birch, the regional professor, from an attacking Poochyena. After defending Birch, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen PokÃ©mon as their starter PokÃ©mon. After that the player encounters May/Brendan, the child of Professor Birch. The player's rival, who appears as the professor's child, is also a PokÃ©mon Trainer and occasionally battles the player.[15] The games' two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Champion to become the new Champion and completing the PokÃ©dex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 PokÃ©mon available between Ruby and Sapphire. It is possible to obtain all 386 PokÃ©mon, but this requires trading with PokÃ©mon FireRed and LeafGreen.[16]
In addition to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks, usually by obtaining items. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use PokÃ©mon to alter the climate of Hoenn: in Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, want to use the legendary PokÃ©mon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to flood the landmasses of Hoenn and increase the region's ocean.[17] Prior to facing the eighth Gym Leader, the player has a showdown with Magma or Aqua where the team's leader uses a mystical orb that awakens the slumbering PokÃ©mon, believing it has the power to enthrall their respective target, only for the PokÃ©mon to become enraged and cause catastrophic, region-wide climate changesâa drought in Ruby, and heavy rainfall in Sapphireâuntil it is defeated or captured by the protagonist.[18] The player's father also introduces them to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a PokÃ©mon to be his companion as he moves away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful PokÃ©mon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.
","The basic mechanics of Ruby and Sapphire are largely the same as their predecessors'. As with all PokÃ©mon games for handheld consoles, gameplay is in third-person, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. Players begin the game with one PokÃ©mon, and can capture more using PokÃ© Balls. They can also use their PokÃ©mon to battle other PokÃ©mon. When the player encounters a wild PokÃ©mon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the PokÃ©mon fight.[1] During battle, the player may use a move, use an item, switch their active PokÃ©mon, or flee, although fleeing is not an option in battles against trainers. All PokÃ©mon have hit points (HP); when a PokÃ©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived. If the player's PokÃ©mon defeats the opposing PokÃ©mon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most PokÃ©mon evolve into a new species of PokÃ©mon when they reach a certain level.[2]
Apart from battling, capturing PokÃ©mon is the most essential element of PokÃ©mon gameplay. During battle with a wild PokÃ©mon, the player may use a PokÃ© Ball on them. If successful, the PokÃ©mon will be added to the player's active party, or stored if the player already has the maximum six PokÃ©mon in their party.[3] Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP, status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep, and the strength of the PokÃ© Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the PokÃ© Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.[4] Other trainers' PokÃ©mon cannot be captured.
The most prominent change in the battle mechanics is the introduction of double battles, in which the opposing parties each use two PokÃ©mon at the same time. Consequently, certain PokÃ©mon moves can affect multiple combatants at once.[5] Multi battles were added alongside double battles. They are identical to double battles, but there are two trainers to a side, each controlling one of the two PokÃ©mon sent out. Also new to the games are innate abilities and natures; the former is shared by every PokÃ©mon of a certain species, while the latter may vary among a particular species. Abilities grant their holders certain powers in battle, such as immunity against certain types of moves or strengthening a certain type of move. Natures, like innate abilities, affect the strength of PokÃ©mon in battle; however, they affect the stats of the PokÃ©mon rather than directly affecting the strength of the moves.[6] Another stat introduced in PokÃ©mon Ruby and Sapphire is Condition, an important factor in PokÃ©mon Contests, mini-games in which participants perform moves before a judge. Both PokÃ©mon and their moves have a Condition, which is increased by using PokÃ©blocks, which are candies made from berries.[7] Secret bases were added as a one off feature where players could open up a hole in the world and customize the area with various items picked up in-game. Players who linked up with others who set up secret bases were able to battle an NPC version of that trainer within their secret base.
Like PokÃ©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, PokÃ©mon Ruby and Sapphire keep track of real-life time; this influences events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, Ruby and Sapphire do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to the differences in the technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, Ruby and Sapphire cannot be linked with PokÃ©mon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the previous generations.[8]
Ruby and Sapphire have limited e-Reader support. Nintendo released Battle-e Cards, a set of e-Reader cards that contained trainer battles in which the player could see previously-hidden PokÃ©mon.[9] A special e-Reader card called the Eon Ticket was also released; obtained through the Mystery Gift function, the Ticket allows the player to reach a place called Southern Island. There, the player faces either Latios or Latias, depending on which version of the game is used.[10]
Ruby and Sapphire are also able to connect to the GameCube games PokÃ©mon Colosseum, PokÃ©mon XD: Gale of Darkness and PokÃ©mon Box: Ruby and Sapphire. In the former two, once players reach a certain point in the game, they are able to transfer PokÃ©mon between Colosseum / XD and Ruby / Sapphire.[11] Additionally, those who pre-ordered Colosseum were able to access the PokÃ©mon Jirachi and see a preview of the movie PokÃ©mon: Jirachi Wish Maker. PokÃ©mon Box allows players to store and organize their PokÃ©mon on the GameCube.[12] Also, in the European version of PokÃ©mon Channel, players could receive a Jirachi at a certain point in the game, which they could then transfer over to Ruby or Sapphire.

PokÃ©mon Box allows players to store and organize their PokÃ©mon on the GameCube.[12] Also, in the European version of PokÃ©mon Channel, players could receive a Jirachi at a certain point in the game, which they could then transfer over to Ruby or Sapphire.

Power Rangers: Dino Thunder,,2004,Natsume,THQ,"NA, PAL","A soccer player, a computer expert, a singer, an artist, and a teacher with a long history of such situations join forces to become Power Rangers and help save the Earth from the scheming of Mesogog, a dinosauric villain who wishes to eradicate all human life and return Earth to the age of dinosaurs. He is assisted by his minions Elsa, Zeltrax, and army of Tyrannodrones, and an army of Triptoids as well as monsters that they call their Mutations.
In this season, Tommy Oliver, from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to Power Rangers Turbo fame, returns as a paleontology professor in Reefside, California. When he is assigned three detention students, athlete Conner McKnight, computer expert Ethan James, and singer Kira Ford, by Principal Randall (the human disguise of Elsa), they end up finding the Dino Gems, paving the way for them to become the Dino Rangers. Conner gains the power of the Tyrannozord (based on the Tyrannosaurus), Ethan gains the power of the Tricerazord (based on the Triceratops), and Kira gains the power of the Pterazord (based on the Pteranodon). Tommy (known often as Dr. O) himself once again becomes a Power Ranger by joining the team as the Black Dino Ranger with the power of invisibility, and they are also later joined by Trent Mercer as the White Dino Ranger, with the power of camouflage. Trent must deal with the inner struggle of good and evil, as Tommy himself once had to do as the evil Green Ranger, because he gained his powers from a raw Dino Gem in Mesogog's lab, with the powers originally intended to be Mesogog's. Mesogog is in fact, Trent's adopted father Anton Mercer, who, in a faulty lab experiment, began to mutate into Mesogog. Trent later sides with good and saves his father from the mutation.
During the course of the series, the team adds the following to its arsenal of Zords: Cephalozord (based on the Pachycephalosaurus), Dimetrozord (based on the Dimetrodon), Stegozord (based on the Stegosaurus), Parasaurzord (based on the Parasaurolophus), and Ankylozord (based on the Ankylosaurus). The Stegozord later combines with Trent's zord the Dragozord (based on the Tupuxuara) to form the Dino Stegozord. Tommy pilots the Brachiozord (based on the Brachiosaurus), the carrier for all the other Zords. Conner is also given the power to become the Triassic Ranger, and pilots the Mezodon Rover/Megazord (based on the Styracosaurus) which can combine with the Cephalo, Dimetro, Parasaur and Ankylozords to form the Triceramax Megazord.
At the end of the series, the Rangers destroy Mesogog with their raw Dino Gem power, but the gems are burned out in the process. Just before this, they are also forced to sacrifice all the Zords in their last battle with Zeltrax. Finally they return to their normal lives.

Power Rangers: Time Force,,2001,Vicarious Visions,THQ,"NA, PAL","In the year 3000, Time Force is a police agency that deals with the crimes of mutants, outcasts of society who have developed super powers. Ransik, one of the most dangerous of the mutants, is arrested and sentenced to life for his crimes including murder and the plan to travel back in time to take over the world. However, after sentencing, he escapes and manages to go back in time to 2001, but seemingly kills Alex, the Red Time Force Ranger, in the process. Alex's fiancÃ© Jennifer Scotts, as well as Time Force members Lucas Kendall, Katie Walker, and Trip Regis, decide to break protocol and go back in time after Ransik. However, upon arriving in 2001, they find that the rest of their Chrono Morphers are locked, and cannot be used until someone with Alex's DNA uses the Red Ranger morpher. To that end, they travel to the town of Silver Hills, Washington, and find Alex's ancestor Wes Collins, the son of a billionaire tech businessman, who unlocks the morphers and then helps them battle Ransik's army of mutants as the Time Force Power Rangers. However, Wes does not initially see eye-to-eye with Jennifer, who is still upset over Alex's death.
As Ransik continues his quest for total domination of Earth, archaeologists discover a box that, unknown to them, contains the Quantum Ranger morpher and powers. Both Ransik and the Rangers are well aware of its contents, and make attempts to retrieve it. The box eventually falls into the hand of Eric Myers, a member of the Silver Guardians, the city's police force managed by Wes' father, Albert Collins, and Wes' old rival. Eric activates the power, and becomes the Quantum Ranger. Eric, however, becomes cocky and irresponsible with his power, forcing Wes and the Rangers to try to get it back from him; however, Eric defeated them and he kept his powers. Soon he learns the responsibility of using the Quantum Powers and becomes the leader of the Silver Guardians as the Quantum Ranger, and becomes an ally to the Rangers.
Eventually, the Rangers begin receiving help from an unseen ally from the future in the form of the Time Shadow Megazord. Soon, this ally arrives in 2001 and reveals himself to be Alex, stating that he is alive because something the Rangers have done in the present has altered the future, and that he has returned to fix it. Alex reveals to Wes what was meant to happen in the original timeline and encourages him to take action to set it right. Wes reluctantly agrees, and relinquishes control of his morpher to Alex so he can take care of his father's business while his father lays gravely injured in the hospital. Alex then briefly leads the team, but his relationship with the Rangers becomes strained when they realize Alex has changed. Alex eventually realizes that Wes is the true Red Ranger and having destroyed his relationship with Jennifer, returns the morpher.
When Ransik makes his final assault on Earth, with a powerful army in large amounts, Alex orders the Rangers to return to the future, for fear that if they hesitate, they may not be able to return at all. Wes, however, would have to remain behind. The Rangers refuse, and fight Ransik alongside Wes, who, knowing his friends can't stay, forces them into returning to 3000, leaving only himself and Eric to stop Ransik, or die trying.  When the Rangers return to the future, they learn that Silver Hills was saved, but Wes died in the process. The Rangers are ordered to have their minds erased of their memories from 2001, and encouraged to resume their lives. Angered, Jennifer returns Alex's engagement ring, and the Rangers return to 2001 to help Wes and Eric. During the final battle, Ransik accidentally injures his daughter Nadira and, traumatized over nearly killing her, surrenders to the Rangers. Right before the Rangers return Ransik and Nadira to the future, Wes and Jennifer, having soothed over their initially rocky relationship, profess their love for one another. As the Rangers depart, Wes stays behind with Eric to co-command the Silver Guardians.

He encounters the Animarium, an island shaped like a turtle floating in the sky, which many believed to exist only in fairy tales, and is the home of the Wild Zords, and the Rangers' mentor, Princess Shayla. He joins four other Rangers and becomes the new leader of the Wild Force Power Rangers.
The Power Rangers use their powers to defeat the forces of the Orgs, led by one Master Org.

Prehistorik Man,No,2001,Titus Software,Titus Software,"NA, PAL","Prehistorik Man, like its predecessor, takes place in the Stone Age. In the middle of the night, greedy dinosaurs steal all the food from a small village. With winter coming and the village inhabitants facing starvation, the Village Chief summons Sam, a young and agile villager, and tasks him with obtaining food to help the village survive the impending winter.[2]
","The player controls Sam by navigating him through a total of 23 side-scrolling levels. The main task is for the player to collect all the food in each level while defeating enemies to make them drop their bones, which is used as currency in the game. The player starts out with three hearts. If the player loses them all, they lose a life and must restart the level. Midway through each level, there is a checkpoint (called a Rees-Tartah) so Sam will not have to start at the beginning once touched. Sam has many abilities to help the player through each level including running ""like a dog"" to move faster, and the shout which enables the player to defeat all enemies on screen. Sam's default weapon is a spiked club but he can find other weapons like spears and axes which will replace any weapon used before, however, these weapons have limited ammo. Throughout the game, various items can be found varying from ""stone age shields"", which make the player temporarily invincible, heart containers to permanently raise the player's health, and letters which spell out B-O-N-U-S, which when all are collected, send the player to a bonus area for a chance to collect more bones and food. Shops are also available for the player to spend bones to buy various items which the player can use to skip levels or even save their game. At the end of each level, the food is tallied up and the player is given an overall percentage on how well they did. Certain levels have different gameplay gimmicks which the player must learn in order to proceed. The majority of levels are simple platformers but other levels involve the player finding specific key items, limit a player to using a vehicle, or defeating a boss.
In the DSiware version, the player can control Sam by using the touchpad on the bottom screen and Sam's power can increase by collecting upgrades that can last for a limited time. The bottom screen also has an item section to let players know what items they must collect to proceed through the game.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,No,2003,Ubisoft Montreal,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action-adventure puzzle-platformer. The player controls the main protagonist, an unnamed Prince from a kingdom in Persia. Environments are seen through a controllable third-person view. The camera's view changes to different positions triggered by entering certain areas or performing actions.[2][3] The Prince can be moved in all directions, and he is able to manipulate large objects such as blocks and levers connected to mechanisms. His health and power metre are represented in the top left-hand corner of the screen. The Prince restores health by drinking water from pools and fountains. Collecting Sands increases the Prince's power, and drinking from hidden magic fountains increases the Prince's maximum health.[2][4] During several points in the game, the Prince is assisted by his companion Farah, who fires a bow at enemies, though her arrows can also hit the Prince if he strays into her line of fire. Monsters will attack her, and if she is killed, the game ends.[2][5]
During exploration, the Prince navigates areas filled with traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, wall-mounted blades and saws, and spinning spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a wall for a set distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes.[2][4][6] Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them.[6] In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggers different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.[2][7]
The Sands the Prince collects from enemies and the environment are tied to his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to rewind time by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while they are unable to move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out with a small amount of Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.[2]
The Game Boy Advance version shares basic elements with its console counterparts. Displayed from a side-scrolling view, the Prince navigates the palace of Azad using his acrobatic skills. The Rewind ability is still present to save the Prince's life, and is also involved in solving some puzzles and fighting bosses. New moves and abilities are gained by the Prince by performing moves and solving puzzles. Farah is featured as a second playable character in some sections, with switching between the two being key to some puzzles.[8] The mobile version is similarly a side-scroller, featuring simple puzzles and traps. The powers linked to the Sands are absent, but enemies must still be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger. There are three enemy types: archers, flying enemies, and foot soldiers.[9]

Puyo Pop,Yes (SPM),2002,Sonic Team,THQ,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Generally, the objective of Puyo Puyo games is to defeat your opponent by causing the third column from the left of their side of the screen to become filled with Puyo. Puyo are round, slime-like creatures that, in most variations of the game, fall from the top of the screen in groups of two, three, and four. The pieces can be moved, dropped, and rotated as they fall. The piece falls until it reaches another Puyo or the bottom of the screen.[1] When four or more Puyo of the same color line up adjacent to each other, the Puyo will connect to each other, ""Pop"", and disappear. Puyo of the same color can connect horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.[citation needed]
The Puyo above those that are cleared fall onto other pieces or the bottom of the screen. Simultaneous Pops (åææ¶ã, simultaneous erasing) are created when more than one group is formed at a time.[citation needed]
A Chain is made when falling Puyo cause a new group of Puyo to Pop, making a chain reaction. When a Chain is achieved, Nuisance Puyo, or Ojama Puyo (ãéªé­ã·ã, hindrance Puyo) are sent to either clog the opponent's screen or to cancel out (offset, ç¸æ®º) the Nuisance Puyo sent by the opponent. Nuisance Puyo are translucent pieces that disappear when Puyo are popped next to them. If multiple groups of Puyo are cleared in succession due to a chain, the amount of Nuisance Puyo will increase based solely on the number of steps in the chain. Nuisance Puyo are cached above the opponent's playing field, and do not fall until the attacker's chain concludes, and then the defender puts down a piece. Nuisance Puyo block the opponents' playing fields, and can cause them to lose if one is placed the third spot from the left in the top row.[citation needed]

Puyo Pop Fever|Puyo Puyo FeverJP,Yes (SPM),2004,Sonic Team,Sega,"PAL, JP","Ms. Accord, a teacher at the Primp Magic School, has lost her Flying Cane, the equivalent of a magic wand, and claims to have a reward for the student who can find it. The player plays the role of either Amitie or Raffine, students at the school, as they venture across the Puyo Pop Fever world to find the cane, while meeting many wacky characters along the way and battling them. Raffine's course contains more difficult gameplay and alters the characters the player meets, as well as which character actually finds the wand. When playing as Raffine near to the end of the game, it is revealed that Accord never actually lost her flying cane. Raffine then plans on revealing her and Popoi's secret, but fails in her ending, as she is knocked unconscious by Ms. Accord, losing all memories of the flying cane incident. She regains consciousness near her school where Amitie and her friends congratulate her.
","The basic game mechanics are mainly similar to those of Puyo Puyo: the player has a 6x12 board, and must decide where to place incoming groups of variously-colored blobs, or puyo. After placing each set of puyo, any groups of four or more of the same colored adjacent puyo will pop. Any above will fall down and can form more groups for a chain reaction.
Each time groups of puyo pop, the player will score points and send ""trash"" (aka ""garbage"" and ""nuisance"") to their opponent. Garbage temporarily gets stored in a bar above the playfield, represented by symbols and warning the player of an incoming amount of garbage. These trash puyo are colorless and will only pop when puyo next to them do so, rather than in groups as normal. These will only fall if the player fails to make a chain, and trash falls in groups of 30 (one rock) at a time.  When a player's board fills up, either if they cannot make groups or if they are sent a large amount of trash (usually the latter), they lose and the other player will win.
A new addition to the game mechanics is Fever mode. Fever mode occurs when a bar in the middle of the screen is filled up. To fill the bar, one must offset (or counterattack) the trash being sent to the field by the opponent. Every chain, which is a single popping of puyo, will fill one space in the fever meter until it is full, which is when fever activates. In fever mode, a pre-designed chain will fall onto an empty field. In a limited amount of time, one must find a trigger point in the puzzle, which will cause a large chain to go off and attack the opponent. Once a chain is made, another puzzle falls, bigger and more complicated than the previous one. This keeps occurring until time runs out, then it returns the player to their original field.
The Nintendo DS version supports 2 to 8 players, as opposed to the others which only support 2 or 4. In this mode, one can play as any available character.
There is also an endless mode, where one can practice fever mode, complete small tasks as they are given, or play the original game. However, the grid and all clear rules remain the same as they do in fever, so it's not exactly classic.

R-Type III: The Third Lightning,,2004,Raylight Studios,Destination Software,"NA, PAL",NaN,"R-Type III: The Third Lightning was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.
It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original red-blue-yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles.
A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.
The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ã RagnarÃ¶k; it was originally referred to as the 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as the Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9Ã2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.

Lucia's objective is to destroy the world, which is actually a parallel dimension created by his ancestor with Etherion after the original was ruined by a plague and his family was cursed as a result. After Haru finds all of the Raves, Elie uses Etherion to combine them. In order to avoid another Overdrive, Haru and his friends oppose Lucia and his strongest enemies in the Star Memory. Although Haru defeats Lucia, he is absorbed by Endless and convinces Elie to destroy it even if it means taking his life. One year later, Elie has lost her memories of Haru, and she and the others visit his grave. Haru appears alive thanks to the Star Memory's magic and reunites with Elie, who then remembers him. The warriors go their separate ways, and Haru and Elie return to Garage Island to live together.

Rayman 3,Yes (SPM),2003,Ubisoft,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","One night, a Black Lum, who was supposedly said to have grown out of pure evil, named AndrÃ© appears, and transforms other Red Lums into Black Lums to join him. The group eventually gains enough hair from various animals throughout the forest to dress themselves as scarecrow-like Hoodlums. In the middle of the process, Murfy, one of the residents and workers of the Fairy Council, discovers them. AndrÃ© later discovers him hiding nearby, and he and his Black Lums pursue him. Murfy is chased to a small clearing, where Rayman and his friend Globox are sound asleep. Just after Murfy reaches them, Globox is awakened by the commotion. Now aware of the situation, Globox helps Murfy to try and get Rayman, who is still asleep, to safety. In the process, Globox accidentally removes Rayman's hands, forcing Murfy to pick Rayman up by his hair and fly him away from the clearing himself. In an attempt to save himself, Globox runs away to safety, taking Rayman's hands along with him.
As time passes, more and more Hoodlums invade the forest. After Rayman wakes up, he and Murfy reach the entrance to the Council and discover Globox hiding in a barrel. Just as Rayman gets his hands back from Globox, AndrÃ© and a few of his minions appear, following Globox as he flees into the Council. As Rayman and Murfy pursue them, they learn of AndrÃ©'s evil plan: to taint the heart of the world so that he can create an army of Hoodlums. Eventually, AndrÃ© catches up with Globox, who ends up accidentally swallowing the evil creature. Afterwards, Rayman attempts to seek out a doctor that can rid AndrÃ© from Globox's insides and Murfy departs from the team, warning Rayman the Black Lum may force Globox to drink plum juice, in spite of the latter's allergy to it. Rayman meets up with three doctors: Otto Psi (a play on the word autopsy), Romeo Patti (homeopathy), and Art Rytus (arthritis). After all three doctors make independent attempts at purging AndrÃ© by using various parts of Globox's body as musical instruments, they succeed in getting rid of him after collaborating in Art Rytus' clinic room. Refusing to admit defeat, AndrÃ© teams up with Reflux, a member of the Knaaren race that Rayman had previously defeated.
Reflux steals the scepter of the Leptys â a god worshiped by his people â from the child king of the Knaaren and uses it to increase his power, which in turn will allow Andre to infinitely reproduce.  With Globox's help, Rayman climbs to the top of the Tower of the Leptys and faces Reflux and AndrÃ© as the former transforms into a giant winged monster.  After a prolonged battle, Rayman and Globox destroy Reflux and Rayman turns AndrÃ© back into a Red Lum which results in all the Black Lums turning back into Red Lums.  Shortly thereafter, Rayman and Globox return to the clearing that they were in before. Before they resume their nap, Globox admits that he misses AndrÃ© and would like him back, but Rayman says that's not a good idea and that he doesn't know how. Globox says that a Red Lum has to be scared to be a Black Lum to which Rayman replies that he would hate to imagine what could scare a Lum.  A flashback to before the beginning of the game reveals that Rayman unwittingly created AndrÃ© when his hands went off on their own and scared a Red Lum with frightening shadow puppets.
","Rayman's controls are similar to that of Rayman 2: The Great Escape, albeit utilising long-ranged punches (and kicks at some opportunities), instead of throwing Energy Spheres. Instead of permanent upgrades to his abilities, Rayman can now find special ""Laser Detergent"" cans (used by the Hoodlums to turn their clothes into combat fatigues) containing one of five temporary power-ups. The Vortex allows Rayman to fire mini-tornadoes instead of punching, the Heavy Metal Fist increases Rayman's strength and allows him to break down certain doors, the Lockjaw gives Rayman extendable claw weapons that can be used to latch onto and electrocute enemies or swing across gaps, the Shock Rocket allows Rayman to fire a remote controlled missile, and the Throttle Copter provides Rayman with a special helmet that allows him to fly vertically for a limited time.
Unlike most entries, Rayman 3 features a scoring system that tallies points based on Rayman's actions. Whenever points are scored, the system switches to a ""Combo mode"" that adds even more points acquired from such actions, though if the player's scoring stops after a few seconds, the Combo mode ends as well. If using a power-up acquired from a Laser Detergent, points earned are doubled. Points earned can unlock hidden content and, in some levels, allow access to hidden areas.

Rayman Advance,No,2001,Digital Eclipse,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","In the planet in which Rayman lives, people are harmonious thanks to the Great Protoon. However one day, the evil Mr. Dark steals the Protoon, leading to the Electoons, other beings that maintain harmony on Rayman's planet, to scatter all over the world. Betilla the Fairy battled Mr. Dark to get back the Protoon and Electoons, but in vain. So Rayman decides to go and retrieve the Electoons and Protoon and defeat Mr. Dark.[3] Betilla the Fairy, a guardian of the Great Protoon, frequently interacts with Rayman as needed to give him additional magical powers along his journey.
Rayman begins his journey in the Dream Forest, one of the six lands of the valley. He begins with the ability to telescopically punch enemies until Betilla gives him the ability to hang onto ledges. He encounters a kindly local named Tarayzan, who hands over an instantly-sprouting magic seed to help him escape a rising flood. At the end of the Dream Forest, Rayman defeats the first of the game's six bosses, the giant Moskito.[4] Betilla then gives Rayman the power to swing from flying hoops. Rayman arrives in Band Land, a world built around clouds and musical notes, symbols, and instruments. He is chased by Mr. Sax, a giant angry saxophone.[4] Betilla grants Rayman the power to spin his hair like a helicopter for gliding. After defeating Mr. Sax, Rayman progresses through the Blue Mountains, a world of avalanches and rock monsters. He meets the family of musician friend and helps him build a new guitar in exchange for a potion that lets Rayman fly continually using his helicopter hair. Rayman defeats Mr. Stone,[4] and Betilla gives him the ability to run. Picture City, the fourth land, is a world of paintings and art utensils, including slippery ink floors and deadly sharp pencils. Rayman makes his way through to arrive on the stage of a pirate-themed play, where a vicious actress in a Viking costume emerges from the ship's cannon and hurls knives at him. Later, Rayman again encounters this actress who turns out to be the area's boss, Space Mama,[4] in an astronaut costume. Following her defeat, Rayman learns that Mr. Dark has kidnapped Betilla and imprisoned her in one of the little spheres attached to his hat.
Rayman reaches the fifth land, the Caves of Skops, a cave world ruled by Mr. Skops, a giant scorpion. Before he enters he meets Joe, a friendly extraterrestrial, who owns a snack bar whose electric lights have gone out. Joe gives Rayman a firefly to light his way through the cave to reinsert a plug that has fallen out, restoring power to his bar. After crossing a lake and through the caves, Rayman reaches the lair of Mr. Skops and defeats him.[4] After he rescues all of the Electoons, Rayman arrives at the final land, Candy Chateau, made of desserts and crockery. At the end, he faces Mr. Dark[4] who attacks with various disorienting spells. Rayman arrives in the chateau's hall, where Mr. Dark traps him with walls of fire. At the last moment, Electoons retrieve Rayman's ability to punch after Mr. Dark disables it. At this point Mr. Dark (probably using the power of the Great Protoon and Betilla) transforms himself into hybrids of the previous bosses to defeat Rayman. Upon the defeat of the hybrids, Rayman rescues Betilla and recovers the Great Protoon, thus restoring balance to his world. Rayman then takes a vacation with friends and former enemies.
","Rayman is a side-scrolling platform game. The player character is the titular Rayman, who must travel through six worlds (The Dream Forest, Band Land, Blue Mountains, Picture City, The Caves of Skops and Candy ChÃ¢teau) to free all of the caged Electoons, six cages of whom are located somewhere on each level. Only when all the Electoons are freed will Rayman be able to reach and confront Mr Dark at his lair in Candy ChÃ¢teau. Each level is divided into several maps, each of which is completed when Rayman reaches the ""!"" sign at the end. The player is given a certain number of lives, which are lost when Rayman takes too many hits or falls into water or a pit. If all lives are lost at any point, the ""Game Over"" screen will appear, and the player can continue or quit. Scattered around each level are small, sparkling blue spheres called Tings. The player gains an extra life for every 100 Tings picked up (50 in the DSi version). If the player loses a life, any Tings collected are lost. Tings can also be used to pay the Magician, a character found in certain levels, to enter a bonus stage, where Rayman can win an extra life. Rayman's ""telescopic fist"", an ability gained early in the game, allows him to punch enemies from a distance; most enemies can be defeated with a certain number of punches. At the end of each world, Rayman must defeat a boss enemy. The player comes across a variety of other power-ups and bonuses, such as a golden fist (which increases punch strength), a speed fist (which increases the speed of Rayman's punches), a power to restore Rayman's lost life energy, and flying blue elves whose touch shrinks Rayman down in size so he may access new areas.
In early stages of the game, Rayman has the ability to walk, crawl and make silly faces. He obtains additional powers during the game (telescopic punching, holding onto ledges, grappling flying rings, using his hair as helicopter blades to glide, and running) from Betilla the Fairy, while others are given temporarily from his friends that are used for a specific levels only.

Rayman: Hoodlum's RevengeNA|Rayman: Hoodlums' RevengePAL,No,2005,Backbone Entertainment,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","The games begins with Rayman and Globox sleeping in the forest, when Globox's dreams are disturbed by the memory of him swallowing the Black Lum AndrÃ©. He is awakened by a strange sound, and goes off to search for its source (it is possible he was captured by the Hoodlums, since he is later seen in the Bog of Murk, seemingly trapped). Later, Rayman wakes up to find his pal missing, and goes off to look for Globox.
As he journeys onward, Rayman is told by Murfy that the Hoodlums are trying to clone Reflux: the other main rival of Rayman 3, and that the clone is plum juice-powered. Before he finally meets up with Globox, he must destroy the Infernal Machine, which basically makes the potent plum juice.
Meanwhile, in the Bog of Murk, Globox is unknowingly being slowly taken over by AndrÃ©, and this is apparent by Globox's sudden mood swings in which he becomes condescending, aggressive, and just plain mean. Later, when he escapes from prison and reunites with Rayman, Andre often insults Rayman or the feeble attempts of the Hoodlums (""meddlesome loser"" and ""Lame-man"" are some of the jeers he throws at Rayman). However Rayman, unused to Globox being a jerk, or smart in any way, simply does not hear most of it, though at one point he asks Globox if he was hit in the head.
As they continue through the lands they must save the Teensies and defeat a couple of bosses. In the Pit of Endless Fire, after the defeat of the Firemonster, Andre takes full control of Globox and announces his return.
When Rayman finally encounters the cloned Reflux, that uses Globox, body, and defeats him, an unconscious Globox appears as Andre's black spirit flutters away through Globox's mouth, and he awakes his full self, even asking if he missed breakfast. The story ends with the pair walking off into the forest.
","This game is the first Rayman game to be of an isometric platformer, instead of being either a fully 3D or 2D platformer. Most of the levels put the player in control of Rayman, while other levels put the player in control of his partner, Globox. In certain levels, the player is able to control both of them in the same level by pressing the Select button to switch the characters.
The goal of each level is to get to the end and gain the maximum number of points possible. To do this, the player has to collect gems and lums that are scattered throughout the levels. Also, freeing Teensies and defeating enemies gives the player points. At the end of the level, the player earns Murfy stamps, based on their score. Murfy stamps are not important to the completion of the game, but after getting a certain number of them, extra levels are unlocked. There is a total of five levels that can be unlocked with the acquiring of Murfy stamps.

Rayman Raving Rabbids,No,20052006,Visual Impact,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","The Rabbids are the common enemy in this game. Their technology varies from advanced giant robots to close combat tools such as plungers and feather dusters. Characters do not have the voice acting that was first used in Rayman 2: The Great Escape. Instead, the voices become regular gibberish, except for a few words like ""Hey"" and ""Wow"", or ""Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" (in ""Rayman Raving Rabbids Making of"" they said ""Action""). Besides the Rabbids, there are also warthogs, seen in the game's warthog races, and various other animals (such as sheep, cows and pigs). One of the minigames actually requires the player to point the members of the same species out.
The game begins with a cut-scene showing Rayman having a picnic with the local Globox kids. Their picnic is interrupted when an earthquake erupts and the Globox kids sink into the ground while 3 Rabbids appear in their place. Their commander SergueÃ¯ kidnaps Rayman and throws him in an arena with angry Rabbids, several of whom are armed. Rayman must complete his first trials now, and afterwards SergueÃ¯ takes him to his cell and gives him a plunger. Initially the Rabbids jeer him, but as Rayman completes more trials, they grow bored, and eventually he even becomes popular among the Rabbids and they cheer him on, in addition to making his jail cell more hospitable. Eventually, Rayman amasses a collection of plungers as rewards for completing the trials. By building a ladder out of all his plungers to reach the window (and settling with an annoying bird who keeps defecating on him), Rayman manages to escape and free himself. Once liberated, he remembers the Globox kids and attempts to return through one of the Rabbid holes to rescue them, but winds up getting stuck in the hole. In a post-credits scene, Rayman is still stuck in the hole through the night, and sheep come to eat the leftovers of his picnic.
","The game features two different modes of play - 'Story mode' and 'Score mode'. In story mode the game follows fifteen days of Rayman's imprisonment by the Rabbids. Each day, Rayman must complete at least three trials, followed by one special ""boss trial"", such as a first-person rail shooter using plungers, or a racing game in which the player controls a warthog and uses a flyswatter as a riding crop. Completing trials earns Rayman various costumes and matching music, including Gangsta, Raymaninho (a portmanteau of the title character's name and football star Ronaldinho), Disco, Gothic, Caramba, Rock'n'Roll, Granny, DeeJay, and Bunny. Trial completion also earns plungers and after accumulating enough, Rayman builds a ladder up the edge of his jail cell and escapes to freedom. In Score mode, the player can repeat past trials in an attempt to improve their score or can play the game as a multiplayer party game.
Minigames fall into one of four categories: Bunny Hunt, Sports, Challenges, and 'Shake your Booty!' dancing. Bunny Hunt comprises first-person rail shooter stages, all appearing in Story Mode as ""boss"" stages that the player may play for Score, Time, or Survival with the goal of obtaining the highest score possible with only one life. Two players can participate in Co-op Bunny Hunt, but Survival is not available for multiplayer. The Sports minigames can be played for Workout, which requires rapid movement of the Wii Remote, and Precision, which involves the controls of the remote. Sports minigames also include 'Get Going!' racing stages, including four warthog racing games and a skydiving race. Challenges are various games found in Score Mode which must be played one after the other with the goal of a high combined score in a Triathlon, Pentathlon, or Decathlon. The 'Shake your Booty!' category involves dance-themed minigames and are found in Story Mode each day. Also, there are ""Skill"" minigames that do not fall under any of the other categories. Variations of the mini-games are featured in the DS version. Games such as ""Feed the bunnies"", ""Ghost hunt"", ""Bunny invasion"", ""Stop the mines"" and ""Super Rabbid"" are used. The stylus is used for all of the minigames, unlike the rest of the gameplay.
The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game are, unlike their console counterparts, traditional platformers. In the Game Boy Advance version, the costumes that Rayman acquires give him special abilities, such as using the Granny outfit to sneak past cameras, or the DeeJay outfit to break open vents. The Nintendo DS version allows players to use the stylus to perform certain actions, such as controlling wind or setting rabbits on fire.

They insert implants into infants' brains at birth, to be able to track them. As soon as someone turns 30, the aliens take the person away and nothing is known about their subsequent fate.
The main character, Jorel, after losing both his parents to the alien invaders, decides to flee south to Mexico to join the rebel forces and fight the alien invaders. Thanks to his strong psionic resistance, his brain rejected the implant and he brings new hope to the desperate human race looking for a leader.
Later, the true nature of the Zorn and Arelians is revealed. The Arelians, bored of the collective mind of the alien race, enslaved the humans for entertainment. The Zorn, in return for helping the Arelians, were to be allowed to eat any human above the age of 30.
","Unlike in the X-COM: UFO Defense, there is no base building, resource management or research. During combat, the player controls a squad of single-character units and must accomplish various goals. Units have a certain number of action points, which are renewed at the beginning of every turn. Each action, from turning to walking to shooting consumes action points. Therefore, they are only allowed to perform a certain number of actions per turn.
The player may also pick up and use weapons from dead enemies and allies. As ammunition is limited, it is sometimes necessary to loot a corpse in order to keep fighting. As units specialize in different areas, it is important to adopt a strategy that will fully utilize the strength of each of the many weapons used. It is also possible for a character to act as a medic, using a medikit to heal comrades.

Every time a unit damages an enemy, heals an ally, or uses psionics, it gains experience points. Once they have enough, they gain a level which raises their attributes such as strength, constitution, and intelligence at random. They also gain one skill point which the player can assign to a skill of their choosing, such as heavy weapons, hand-to-hand combat, medicine or stealth. Thus, as the game progresses, each unit becomes stronger and they may specialize in a type of weapon or skill above all others. "

Reign of Fire,,2002,Crawfish Interactive,Bam Entertainment,"NA, PAL","The game's story is divided into two campaigns; human and dragon. The human campaign loosely follows the plot of the film, with significant differences. Meanwhile, the dragon campaign chronicles the early years of the human/dragon war up to the game's present timeline. The dragon campaign features an alternative ending in the final mission.
The human campaign begins with the player taking the role of 'The Kid', a new recruit to the Kentucky Irregulars. Hailing from the former United States, The Irregulars are a group of paramilitary dragon slayers and are led by Denton Van Zan. The Irregulars defend The Fort, an old castle in Northumberland that houses a population of survivors led by Quinn Abercromby. The Irregulars are tasked with warding off attacks, firefighting, and rescuing civilians.
Like in the film, Van Zan concludes that all dragons thus far have been female, and that there must be a single male that is key to reproduction. To prove his theory, Van Zan leads the Irregulars to the ruins of a coastal military base in Dover, now used by the dragons as a nesting ground. Upon arrival, Van Zan sends The Kid alone to retrieve dragon eggs while the majority of the brood is away. The Kid manages to successfully retrieve enough eggs before escaping the returning dragons with the Irregulars. Van Zan confirms his theory and leads the Irregulars to London, intending to kill the sole male dragon, known as The Bull.
Once in London, the Irregulars face heavy resistance from the dragons. Van Zan devises a plan to lure out The Bull by destroying several dragon nests. The plan is successful and The Bull arrives. Quinn distracts The Bull while The Kid, Van Zan, and the remaining Irregulars concentrate fire on The Bull, eventually critically injuring The Bull's wings. Van Zan sends The Kid to finish off The Bull deep in dragon territory. After a long and difficult battle, The Kid kills The Bull, ending the dragon threat.
In the dragon campaign, the player assumes the role of a young dragon with above average intelligence, evident by her ability to adapt and exploit situations tactically and strategically. The campaign begins during the early years of the human-dragon war, in which organized human resistance is still significant, but waning. The player dragon assists her sisters in assaulting the Tower of London, the last human stronghold in the city. The dragons are victorious, obliterating the Tower and a nearby warship, pushing the humans out of London.
Some time later, the player dragon attempts to rescue captured dragons from an armoured train heading to a large coastal military base in Dover (the same base featured in the human campaign). The player dragon rescues her sisters and destroys the train, before following the tracks to the base. The base is heavily defended, with the base's array of large-calibre artillery posing a significant threat to the dragons. The player dragon sneaks into the base from the ocean port, annihilating coastal guns, anti-air defences, warships, and finally the superguns. With their last line of defence destroyed, the human military presence in England is broken and the remaining survivors scattered.
The game jumps forward to the year 2020. The player dragon, now fully mature, repeatedly clashes with the Kentucky Irregulars and the survivors in The Fort. The player dragon causes chaos by disrupting Irregular operations and destroying The Fort's food supply. The final mission also presents an alternative ending, in which the dragons assault The Fort with the assistance of The Bull. Despite heavy resistance, the dragons wipe out the defenders and destroy The Fort, permanently establishing dragons as the dominant species.
","The game allows the player to play as both a dragon and a human. As a human, the player takes the role of a survivor, in a third-person vehicle-based shooter - tanks and jeeps most notably, which can all carry rockets and machine gun turrets; if the player is touched by fire from a dragon they must find water to douse the flames or they will die.
As a dragon, the player takes the role of a maturing dragon able to use fireballs to engage targets at range, napalm breath to set targets alight and using their talons to pick up items (including enemy combatants) and use them as makeshift bombs to attack ground targets.

Rhythm Tengoku,Yes,2006,Nintendo SPD,Nintendo,JP,NaN,"Rhythm Tengoku is a rhythm game similar to the WarioWare series of video games due in part to its simplistic controls and art style. It features eight sets which consist of six rhythm games each (all of which are unique to each other). Each set's sixth stage is a remix of the previous games all at once. The games change in turn throughout the remix, which is accompanied by a new song. Some remixes (such as Remix 5) might even have characters wearing alternate costumes. The sixth, seventh and eighth sets consist of stages that were based on previous games, but are much harder. Players unlock more rhythm games by completing the rhythm games in order. The object of each rhythm game is to match the rhythm the game expects of players which varies from stage to stage. The game primarily relies on audio cues to indicate the rhythm; while it uses visual cues as well, it will sometimes subvert players' expectations with them. Each Rhythm Game usually lasts for 1 to 2 minutes, with rare deviations. Players are given one of three ratings at the end of every stage - Try Again, OK, and Superb. Players must achieve an OK rank in order to proceed to the next game. Players who achieve Superb receive a medal which can be used to unlock Endless Games, Rhythm Toys, and Drum Lessons. The player needs to clear all five games and the Remix in the Set with at least an OK to move on. 
On some occasions, players are allowed to attempt a Perfect Campaign of a randomly selected stage. If players make any misses in the stage while making the attempt, a life/chance is lost, and the player must restart the stage from the beginning. Players have three lives/chances to attempt this before it either disappears or moves on to another rhythm game. Players who succeed receive an in-game certificate as well as a gift (varying on the rhythm game). If they obtain all certificates, they get a special certificate as well as access to all songs in the drum mode. The game's drum controls allow players to use the different buttons on the Game Boy Advance to control various aspects of the drums.[2][3]
In the Arcade version of the game, players start the game with two hearts. Each heart is lost when starting a Rhythm Game. Getting a Superb or Perfect gives the player an extra heart. If the player runs out of hearts, they will need to spend a credit to continue (or, depending on the machine's settings, multiple credits, or none if set to Free Mode). All of the Rhythm Games are available from the start in this arcade version, but the player needs to clear all five games per Set with at least an OK in order to play the Remix (Depending on the settings, the Remix may be unselectable, requiring the player to clear all the games in order to play it). There is also a 2 Player Mode for this version. In addition, some games that didn't receive tutorials in the GBA release now have practice sessions for them. If the player has played perfectly for the first half of a Rhythm Game, the ""Go for a Perfect!"" notice will appear on the bottom of the screen, and obtaining it does the same as getting a Superb. The Arcade version has a leaderboard feature, which tallies up the score based on the player's Flow at the end of a stage.

Objects such as brass knuckles, steel pipes, and trashcans can be used as melee weapons or thrown at enemies.[10] However, the characters' effectiveness in battle is determined by several statistics and their knowledge of fighting techniques, such as Grand Slam, Stone Hands, and Dragon Feet, which are purchased as books in shops throughout the city using funds recovered from defeated gang members.[10] This loot may also be spent on various food items and spa treatments which serve to not only revitalize the player's stats, but may also permanently increase attributes like ""Punch"" and ""Kick"" (Foods and items offer varying levels of improvement).
The player can input passwords that keep track of their character's stats, skills, possessions, money, and defeated bosses.[10] There are a total of nine gangs in the original NES version (which are distinguished by the color of their t-shirts) whom the player will encounter during the course of the game, each with their own characteristics and attacking patterns.

Riviera: The Promised Land|Riviera: Yakusoku no Chi RivieraJP,,20042005,Sting,Atlus,"NA, JP","Riviera: The Promised Land draws from diverse mythologies, most prominently Norse, incorporating concepts such as Ragnarok and Yggdrasil into its story. The game takes place mostly on the continent of Riviera, with the characters visiting various locales such as a sinking city, a forest, and an abandoned cemetery.
Riviera offers a cast of six playable characters.
Ein (ã¨ã¯ã»ã«, Ekuseru, Ecthel in the Japanese version) is a Grim Angel, who sacrificed his black wings in order to receive his Diviner, Einherjar. He wears shorts, a vest, gloves, a cape and a scarf; he has grey-black hair and deep blue eyes. He appears to be an average teenage boy and is quite naive, an attribute that annoys both his partners Ledah and Rose. In battle, his primary weapons are swords.
Fia (ãã£ã¢, Fia) is a teenage girl with a caring personality. She wears a long green skirt, and a black vest over a long-sleeved white blouse. She has long green hair tied with a matching ribbon and green eyes. Originally, she shared a house with Lina, but later made room for Ein, Cierra and Serene. She is, like Ein, kind and noble, sometimes stern and serious, and she can cook and mix herbs well, along with being the only character with healing spells. She is extremely mature, despite being the youngest of Ein's four female companions.[2] Sometimes Fia shows signs of shyness toward others, especially Ein, for whom she nurses a soft spot. In battle, her primary weapons are rapiers and swords.
Lina (ã«ã¥ãª, RÅ«ri, Lyuri in the Japanese version) is a sweet, childlike and energetic teenage girl. She wears a flamboyant yellow short-skirt and overcoat. She has brown eyes and orange hair tied into pigtails. Lina enjoys eating, going on adventurous treasure hunts and playing lively games with her friends; she is ignorant about household chores. She constantly gets into situations in which she embarrasses herself, especially around Ein, for whom she hosts a secret infatuation. Her primary weapon in battle are bows and other long range weapons.
Serene (ã»ã¬ã, Serene) is an outgoing, tomboy-ish teenage girl, the same age as Ein. She is an Arc, unlike the majority of the inhabitants of Riviera, who are Sprites. She used to live on Rosalina Island with other Arcs until her entire tribe was killed by the Grim Angel Malice. She alone survives and joins Ein, for whom she develops an infatuation. Serene has large, batlike wings, a trait shared by Arcs. She wears a helmet adorned with a pair of fake cat ears on her shoulder-length dark blue/indigo hair and has blue eyes. She wears a long pale blue vest over a black body-suit and a dark blue shawl. In battle, her primary weapons are scythes and other pole-arms.
Cierra (ã·ã¨ã©, Shiera) is a kind, thoughtful witch. She is the older sister figure of the group[3] and possesses amazing magical powers. She is always optimistic but sometimes clumsy. She rescued Rose after she and Ein were separated, although she accidentally fed her a potion that removed Rose's ability to talk. For enjoyment, she studies and plays with magic. Cierra wears a typical witch's conical hat, red boots, and a revealing, serrated red dress. Her primary weapons in battle are staves and other magical weapons.
Ledah (ã¬ã, Reda) is an experienced warrior and one of three Grim Angels shown in the game. He is a strong, loyal, and very solitary man. It is suggested that he is much older than Ein and his companions, given his experience, and the choice of voice actors for him in the GBA and PSP remakes, but this is debatable. He follows the order of the seven Magi without question. This is because he traded his emotions for his Diviner, Lorelei, preventing him from reconsidering the orders given to him. Ledah is shown as aloof, cynical, and pragmatic. He is voiced by Kyle Hebert in English.[4]
The above characters are the only playable characters in the game. Riviera has several dozen supporting characters, notably Rose (Ein's familiar); Hector (the game's main villain, voiced by Keith Silverstein in English[5]); Malice (grim angel and Hector's henchwoman); Ursula, guardian spirit of Riviera; and the Four Accursed, who act as Stage bosses. There are also numerous Elendian citizens, fairies and undines who help Ein along the way.
A thousand years before the game takes place, a war known as Ragnarok took place. The gods of Asgard were attacked and overrun by demons from Utgard. In desperation, the gods broke an ancient covenant; they sacrificed their lives to create black-winged reapers that came to be known as Grim Angels. Each was armed with a ""Diviner"", a sacred weapon with which they easily vanquished the demons. After the war ended, Utgard was renamed Riviera and turned into a beautiful paradise. The gods left their knowledge and authority in the stewardship of seven Magi and their power in the care of the Sprites, the inhabitants of a peaceful Riviera.
After a thousand years of peace, rumors of the demonsâ return surfaced. Hector, one of the Seven Magi, sends the Grim Angels Ein and Ledah to Riviera, accompanied by Ein's familiar, Rose. They are ordered to activate the ""Retribution"", a hidden power of the gods which would eliminate the demons but destroy Riviera in the process. At the end of Heaven's Gate, they meet Ursula, the guardian of Riviera. Ein falls in battle and is taken to Yggdrasil, the heart of Riviera, by Ursula. Discovering that he has a good heart, she entrusts him with the protection of Riviera.
Ein wakes up suffering from amnesia and able to recall neither his purpose nor his origin. He is nursed by Fia and Lina, residents of Elendia, which is a village near Yggdrasil. News about the rebirth of the ""Accursed"" â the ""progenitors of evil"" â reaches them and they set out to investigate. Eventually, they defeat all four and meet Serene, Cierra and even Rose along the way. Meanwhile, Ledah searches for Yggdrasil, so that he may activate the ""Retribution"".
Ein now expects to live peacefully in Elendia with his new-found friends, but Ursula informs them that Ledah has breached Yggdrasil and intends to destroy the three ""Aquariums"", the sources of Yggdrasil's power, in an attempt to activate the Retribution. The six companions (Ein, Lina, Fia, Serene, Cierra and Rose) head out to Yggdrasil. Although they manage to subdue Ledah in battle, it is the Grim Angel Malice, Hector's pawn, who deals the fatal blow. A dying Ledah warns them that Hector has tricked them all this time: he does not fulfill the will of the gods, but seeks ultimate power for himself.
They pursue Malice, but are unable to prevent her from destroying the last Aquarium. They battle her, and eventually Ledah appears to intercept one of Malice's attacks. Ledah dies soon after, telling Ein to stop Hector. The companions then race to the ""Maze of Shadows"" where Seth, the Sealed One, is imprisoned. There, Hector takes the life of Malice and the girl that Ein has become closest to; the last two souls required to unleash Seth. Hector intends to become the one True God, and to this end he fuses his body with that of Seth to become Seth-Rah. However, Ein and his companions are able to defeat Seth-Rah, and afterwards they are teleported back to Yggdrasil by Ursula just before the entire Maze collapses.
Upon their return, Ursula reveals that, with the death of her counterpart Seth, she too will cease to exist. Before disappearing, she resurrects the girl that Hector killed, and also charges Ein, Fia, Lina, Serene, Cierra and Rose with the continued protection of Riviera.
Since Riviera is a renai, the player can achieve multiple endings depending on his responses to his companions. Depending upon them, an ending may be achieved with Ein and the girl of choice having a special scene together. The ending with Rose is a hidden ending, as it was not in the original WSC game, and Rose doesn't have a trust stat in the game. The last frame also tells (no matter what the ending) that Rose becomes a historian in later life and records their adventures.
","Riviera: The Promised Land is a turn-based role-playing video game, with some elements from strategy and dating sim games. The last aspect manifests itself in the conversation in the game. Ein will often have to favor either Fia, Lina, Serene or Cierra over the others in scenes in which the characters interact with each other. This affects their trust for Ein, their mood, and eventually, the game's outcome.
For each of the seven main chapters of the game, the player starts in Elendia, and is given a mission. The player then moves on to wherever that mission takes place, proceeding through nine stages, to the eighth stage which will contain the chapter boss. The ninth stage is secret, and often has a particular method of infiltration. Within each stage are multiple screens, all with events and battles of their own. When a chapter is completed, all trigger points currently accumulated are erased. The player is taken to a results screen showing how they performed in the chapter, and gains trigger points based on that performance that can be used in the next chapter.
Unlike most RPGs, when not in battle, the player does not have full control over Ein's movement. Instead of being able to freely move with directional buttons, the player controls Ein through triggers, in two modes. Each stage is made up of several screens, each screen having triggers to explore and potentially battles to engage in.
In Look Mode, the player may press directional buttons corresponding to triggers shown on the screen. Some triggers will not appear until certain events have taken place, and some triggers will change based on repeated investigation. However, many triggers require TP, Trigger Points, earned in battle. These triggers can cue many things, from battles, to event scenes and free items.
In Move Mode, the player may advance or backtrack (limited) to previous screens. In a similar fashion to Look Mode, triggers will appear on the screen and a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count. Unlike Look Mode, however, triggers in Move Mode do not require Trigger Points, so one may move as much as one likes, assuming there is no turn limit. Once the player has exited the final screen of a stage, the player will be prompted to save and then move on to the next stage.
Before a battle begins, the player usually has the choice to retreat, giving them time to prepare. For every battle, the player may choose only three combatants out of a possible five, and a positioning scheme for them. The player can either choose the Attack or Magic formation. The Attack formation allows Attack based moves a shorter recharge time, and there will be two characters in the front row, and a single character in the back row. In Magic formation, Magic users have a shorter recharge time and positioning is reversed. Following that decision the player must choose the items to bring. Only sixteen items can be held at any time, and there are no methods of storage. The player may only bring four of those sixteen items into battle for all three characters to use. However, for every item, each character has a different attack; where, with a staff, Cierra might do great damage with a magical attack, Fia would heal an ally.
Once all the preparations are made, battle begins. Turn order is decided by a countdown based on agility, last move used and formation. A player character may select from as many as eight different skills: one normal skill for each item, and, if they are well trained with that item and the OverDrive Gauge is sufficiently filled, a secondary, more interesting OverSkill. Using a skill, however, reduces how many more times that item can be used, as Riviera employs a Fire Emblem-styled system of item endurance allowing the item to be used only a certain number of times before it breaks entirely. The OverDrive Gauge fills throughout battle, as characters receive and deal damage, and with certain skills. At various levels, characters can use different skills, because certain skills require more of the gauge be filled. There are five levels of skills for player characters: Level 0 skills that may be used whenever and without training; Levels 1 through 3 skills, which require training and deplete that amount of the OverDrive Gauge; and Execution Level skills that may be used at any level of OverDrive Gauge fullness, but will shatter the gauge for the battle, and are only obtained through the story. Enemies have a similar gauge with three levels: Normal, Rage and Max. At Normal they may only use normal attacks. At Rage they may use Rage and Normal attacks, but the latter depletes the gauge. At Max, they may use all three, but only Max skills will deplete the gauge, and will deplete it fully. Enemies also have Etc. attacks, ranging from healing to transformation, that may be used at any time.
Once all allies have had their HP depleted to zero, the battle will end triggering a Game Over, which will give the player the option to retry the battle with the enemies' stats lowered and the OverDrive Gauge filled. If all enemies have had their HP deplete to zero, instead, the player will achieve victory and receive a rank based on their performance in battle. The rank is based both on time spent in battle and the finisher, but the rank will also be lowered if the player retried. Trigger Points and items are distributed based on the rank the player obtained in the battle. Also, if a character used an item enough times, that character will be rewarded with a stat up and the unlocking of an OverSkill that can be used in later battles.

Road Rash: Jailbreak,,2003,Magic Pockets,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game plays similarly to previous games developed in the Road Rash series, which involves the player racing their motorcycle against other motorcyclists. Gameplay favors an arcade-like style, with little emphasis on realism. While racing, the player has the option of punching, or using weapons to attack other opponents, to slow down their progress. The ultimate goal is to place first in the race in order to earn points to upgrade the player's weapon and nitro. Conversely, the worst quote is to finish last, which doesn't earn points, or be stopped by police officers, where the player actually loses points. Despite sharing many characteristics with past games in the series, Road Rash Jailbreak puts a stronger emphasis on the racing aspect of the game, and less on combat.
The individual courses for the game are pieced together from a larger system of interconnected grids of roads. Courses may overlap common segments of other tracks, but often have different start or end points, or have the player turning down alternate routes. The modes on Road Rash Jailbreak are: Jailbreak, Five-O, Time Trial, Cops and Robbers, Skull-to-skull, and Sidecar mode.

Robot Wars: Advanced Destruction,,20012002,Crawfish Interactive,VU Games,"PAL, NA",NaN,"Like the previous game, Robot Wars: Arenas of Destruction, Advanced Destruction featured more than one arena to play in. This game featured four different arenas, War Zone - which is based on the Series 4 version of the Robot Wars Arena, Robot Factory, Steelworks, and Power Station.
In the game, a competitor robot from the series, or a robot created by the player, is entered into combat against a robot controlled by the game. A bout finishes when one robot's health bar is fully depleted or is pitted. In the Championship Mode, the player picks a robot and controls it through seven battles with the first battle being a three-way melee like Series 4.
Multiplayer is also available where up to four players can play.
There were 16 competitor robots in the game including Series champions Chaos 2, Panic Attack, Razer and Tornado.
Like in the other games, series presenter Craig Charles does not appear in the game but the commentator, Jonathan Pearce, appears. However, unlike Robot Wars: Arenas of Destruction, he does not commentate in the entire battle.
"
Robot Wars: Extreme Destruction,,2002,Gamezlab,BBC Multimedia,PAL,NaN,"The player controls a radio-controlled robot which battles it out with other robots in order to win.
In the PC and Xbox versions the main game mode is Competition mode. In this mode the player must either build or buy a robot and compete in various different tournaments. By winning these tournaments, the player earns more money and unlocks new components, robots and arenas.  In total there are eight stages, each featuring a different number of tournaments. When all eight stages are completed, the player takes part in the Final Battle, which is an endurance battle against various real-life competitor robots and one House robot entering the arena last.
There are a total of seventeen playable real life competitor robots from the actual Robot Wars televised show including Series champions Chaos 2, Panic Attack, Razer and Tornado. There are also another forty original robots as well.
In the Game Boy Advance version the player must compete in various events to unlock new robots. Every event has the option of choosing bronze, silver, or gold, depending on what level of difficulty the player prefers. Initially, only the bronze level is available and silver and gold must be unlocked. Specific robots are fought against in each difficulty level. Among the events were tournament mode where the player must win four one-on-one battles, Mayhem, where the player must win a four-way melee, Bash N' Dash, where the player must survive against three opponents which are teamed up against the player and Gauntlet mode, in which the player must perform tasks within a time limit. In this version there are seventeen playable real life robots, sixteen of whom must be defeated in order to be unlocked and no original robots.
Craig Charles does not appear in either game, even though he had been the presenter of the series since its second season, but the commentator, Jonathan Pearce, provides commentary on statistics of the battle, the information relative to the arena and a description of the robots competing in the PC and Xbox. Though there is no commentary in the Game Boy Advance version, Jonathan Pearce can be heard calling out ""3... 2... 1... Activate!"" at the beginning of each match and ""Cease!"" at the end.

Robotech: The Macross Saga,,2002,Lucky Chicken,TDK Mediactive,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game centres on the piloting of Veritech Fighters, the transformable mecha that are a notable feature of the Robotech series. The different modes offer unique advantages and vulnerabilities. Fighter mode has the fastest movement, but can't touch the ground. Battloid mode offers much better aim, but mobility is greatly diminished. While the hybrid Guardian mode splits the difference by combining and averaging these features.
The player can choose from their favorite Macross Saga characters (as seen on Masterpiece Collection toys released at the time). Each character offers varying levels of Power (Quantity of missiles), Stamina (Life energy), Strength (Strength of attacks), Piloting (Speed of movement) and Speed (Speed of Battloid).
After every few side-scrolling missions, there is an isometric view Destroid mission. Destroids are non-transformable Battloids that serve a similar role as a walking tank. The player can choose from a number of Destroids with different abilities.
The game also included a number of unlockable characters who like the main characters have different power levels. Many also fly different vehicles with their own quirks. Each main character you complete the game with unlocks their secret counterpart.
Link cable support allows for up to four player multiplayer.

Robots,,2005,Amaze Entertainment,Sierra Entertainment,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"This game features Rodney Copperbottom as the playable main character. The player can also play as the Wonderbot in certain areas, and Bigweld in the chase scene.
Rodney can invent different devices by collecting a certain amount of blueprints scattered throughout the environment. In the beginning of the game, he repairs his Wonderbot, his personal companion. He also obtains the Scrap Launcher from Herb Copperbottom, a weapon which uses Scrap as ammo which is found in the worlds of the game, and a wrench which is used as a melee weapon. More weapons are acquired throughout the course of the game. Scrap is also used to purchase items at vendors, including the Maxi-Scrap 500 and Maxi-Scrap 1000 which upgrades his Scrap capacity from 200 to 500 and 1000 respectively, the Refine-O-Max which doubles the value of Scrap, and four mutually exclusive upgrades to his Scrap Launcher which can be replaced at any time. Later while in Robot City he obtains the Magnabeam from Jack Hammer, which uses energy which must be refilled by going on recharge circles, and can also be used as a weapon.
The GBA game functions as more of a Metroidvania-style game, where Rodney has to platform and fight enemies across a sizable world map, collecting upgrades by beating bosses and finding parts scattered across the city for different robots also scattered across the city. The weapons you gain open new areas of the map. 
There are a handful of small minigames as well, from a game where you toss oil cans at customers to surviving a torrent of dominos. The fast travel system, taken from the film's transit system, also has a small mini-game where you can collect extra ammunition for weapons. 
The scrap launcher remains from the console ports, though you obtain it through delivering an item in the first area rather than getting it from one of the movie characters. The Magnet Bomb attracts enemies closer to it and hits certain switches, and an Electric weapon that does the most damage and hits certain switches. Upgrades can be found for each that allow them to do more damage and have a longer range.

Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots,,2006,Full Fat,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"As is common to fighting games, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots pits a player-controlled character, in this case, the titular robot, against one controlled by the game engine or another human player. The primary buttons of the Game Boy Advance are used to perform punches, and holding down the buttons allows the player to unleash a more powerful attack. Once the opposing robot's energy has been depleted, the player must press the L and R trigger buttons alternately in order to deliver a knockout blow.[2]
The game has multiple different colored characters, each with different stats(however most of them are the same). In the character selection, each robot has a different head, but are all the same in-game.

Rock n' Roll Racing,Yes,2003,Mass Media,Blizzard Classic Arcade,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The game pits four racers against each other, with up to two of them being player-controlled from a colourful collection of comic book inspired humans and aliens and the rest being AI opponents; 'Rip' and 'Shred' who appear in all races plus a third character unique to each planet/level in one player mode.  Each race consists of four laps around tracks viewed from an isometric perspective, which enables players to discern the presence of frequent sloping sections spread throughout the game's various tracks. In addition to navigating the turns, racers must also maneuver hills and dips without falling or jumping over the guard rail at the track's edge.
While it is a racing game, there is heavy emphasis on attacking competitor's vehicles; since the cars always reappear with full health just a few seconds after blowing up, the only ""harm"" done is falling behind in the race. Players are rewarded with a monetary ""attack bonus"" each time they provide the finishing blow against another car using their forward or rear weapons (and a similar ""lapping bonus"" when they gain a full one-lap lead on an opponent during the race). In accordance with the continual destruction and restoration of the racing vehicles, the tracks are littered with mines and health power-ups, as well as money power-ups. Other hazards include oil slicks, snow drifts, and lava, depending on the planet hosting the race.
Players are updated on the race by commentator ""Loudmouth Larry"" (Larry ""Supermouth"" Huffman), who makes enthusiastic comments like ""The stage is set, the green flag drops!"" (or ""Let the carnage begin!""), and ""(player name) is about to blow!"" at appropriate moments during the race.
Between races, players can spend the money they have earned on more advanced equipment for their vehicle (engines, tires, shocks, and shielding) or on increasing their capacity for the frontal weapon (energy blasts or missiles), rear weapon (slip sauce or mines), and turbo boost (jump jets or nitro boosts), each of which can max out at seven. Despite their limited capacity, every vehicle will have its weapon and boost charges replenished at the completion of each lap in a race. Racers can also buy more advanced vehicle models; however, all equipment and weapons upgrades are lost when a new vehicle is purchased.
The first three drivers to complete a race are awarded both money and points according to the final standings. Points are required for advancement to the next racing division or the next planet, with two divisions on each planet. A player who has not obtained enough points during a division's racing season must repeat the division, again starting with zero points, but all changes to the player's money and car remain in effect. In two-player mode, when only one player has sufficient points, the character in charge of advancement asks ""Leave your loser friend behind?"", allowing the leading player to continue alone by removing the other player from the game. The dropped player can continue from that point later by using their most recent password, once the game is reset.
The songs were uncredited but included:
Passwords are given out at the beginning of each new ""racing season"" (each planet has its own definition of how many races make up a season, but early advancement will automatically start a new season), and they are located at the bottom of the F/X screen (accessible from the menu between races). These passwords are a complex code, consisting of three 4-digit sections, and they dictate everything about the players' progress: the character used, the vehicle type and color, weapons and parts upgrades, racing planet and division, difficulty setting, and money. The Game Boy Advance version of the game uses an EEPROM chip to save the player's progress in lieu of the password system.
The password codes only allow the player to save a maximum of $999,990 (six digits); if there are more than six figures in the bank account, the password truncates the leftmost digits over six (e.g. if there's $1,002,000 when the player quits, there will be only $2,000 when using the password to continue later). Due to the two-player password function, it's possible to ""cheat"" by entering the same password for both players or by entering passwords for players who were at entirely different points in the game. The password with the lowest difficulty setting and on the earliest planet and racing division will be used as the basis for play from then on, which allows for a Warrior-skill character with a maxed-out vehicle to race against Rookie-class AIs in the Rookie skill mode.
Though a password generator QBASIC program exists, the passwords it creates often result in a glitch, causing the player to race on glitchy planetsâthat exist only as a bug and can crash the gameâafter racing on Inferno. In the Rookie skill mode, however, they work perfectly, as long as one doesn't try to take the character beyond the third planet using the password.[3]
A second password generator has been written in JavaScript which limits the available planets to reflect the chosen skill mode while retaining the ability to customize any other aspect of the data stored in the password.[4]

After investigation, they find out a company called Golem Industries has stolen all of the sand and the gang decide to go about stopping them.
They end up going to the lakes, where they discover that the water from there has also been stolen by Golem Industries. The water is found out to be used to ship electricity to a secret base. The gang end up destroying the water plants, and after a confrontation with the ""Barramundi Bot"", they return to Ocean Shores.
They eventually arrive at ""Wishing Waters"", the location of the secret base, which is revealed to be a giant robot factory underneath a water park controlled by a sentient supercomputer. Sam hacks into the computer's programming to build a robot to gain access to robot only areas. After exploring most of the base, they come into contact with ""Cyrax"", the supercomputer controlling the factory. Cyrax destroys the robot thereafter. After Team Rocket Power destroys all of Cyrax's computer chips with skateboards, Cyrax promptly explodes and the gang gets away.
After coming back to Ocean Shores for a second time, the gang challenges Lars to a downhill dirt track race, and after winning manage to convince Lars to give them the secret location to Golem Industries' headquarters.
Once they make it inside the base, they find a massive earthquake machine that Golem Sr, the owner of Golem Industries is controlling. In the cutscene that follows, Golem turns the machine on, and after the base rumbles a pipe knocks into him, sending him into a pool of lava. Golem then comes out of the lava and is revealed to be a robot. The gang confront Golem and destroy him.
After the gang returns to Ocean Shores for a final time, they find out that the mastermind behind the entire plan has been Eric Golem Jr, the alleged son of Golem Sr. He threatens to destroy all of Ocean Shores with a giant tsunami machine. In order to stop this, the gang challenges Eric to a final set of race challenges. After the third battle however, Eric quits the challenges and runs to the control room, prompting Otto to race him via hoverboard to get to the control room before he does. After winning, the base is destroyed. During the final scene, the gang forgives Eric for everything that he has done, and says that he should make some friends that are human.

Rockman EXE 4.5: Real Operation,,2004,Capcom Production Studio 2,Capcom,JP,NaN,"In Real Operation, the Game Boy Advance itself acts as a PET, allowing the player to control various NetNavis from previous games in the series.  The game could also be used with the Battle Chip Gate, a Game Boy accessory that allowed players to use real-life toy Battle Chips for use in the game, a feature that would be carried over to later games in the series.  Users of Real Operation can also play multiplayer games against Battle Network 4 users and other Real Operation users. Due to the Battle Chip gate being an important part of much of the gameplay, the game was not released out of Japan for that very reason, due to the accessories, like the e-reader not being very popular in the US.
Real Operation is also compatible with the Nintendo e-Reader, which allows for the unlocking of certain Navis, some of which are required to complete the game. Navis also give unique features and mini-games to the player, such as NumberMan who will help the player study math problems, and each Navi has different personality traits to alter the playing experience as they speak and interact with you. The game also features a real-time system and on certain days of the week, tournaments will be held in-game that the player can compete in, or you can set reminders on calendars that your Navi will keep track of. Darkloid versions of Navis that appeared in Mega Man Battle Network 4 (such as TopMan) also appear in cyberspace for the player to battle against.
During the course of the game, you do not actually manually control the NetNavis in battle like you do in the other Battle Network games. Instead, they move on their own, and you provide the Battle Chips for them either by selecting them during battle (in the same fashion as older Battle Network games) or by manually slotting them into the Battle Chip Gate. You can also alter their evasion strategies to guide them closer or farther from the enemies to set up attacks. This is to simulate an actual PET experience with the player as the NetOperator, and as such, no human characters appear in the game.
While the game was not released in the US, hacking in Battle Network 5: Double Team DS shows that the game can in fact, be run exactly the same way as 4.5, using the same windows and such, though the player is stuck using only Megaman and whatever chips they start with.
Initially, the player can only choose from MegaMan, Roll, GutsMan, and NumberMan as their Navi companion. However, by slotting-in the corresponding NetNavi battle chip into the Battle Chip Gate, more Navis will be unlocked for the player to use. Each Navi has unique battling styles, personalities, and mini-games to interact with. There are a total of 21 Navis for the player to use, including all 12 Soul Unison Navis from Mega Man Battle Network 4. StarMan is the only Navi who did not previously appear in a title released on the Game Boy Advance. (His only prior appearance was the GameCube-exclusive Mega Man Network Transmission.)
The playable Navis include MegaMan (Rockman in Japan), Roll, GutsMan, NumberMan, FireMan, WoodMan, WindMan, SearchMan, AquaMan (also known as SpoutMan in Battle Network 6), ThunderMan, MetalMan, JunkMan, ProtoMan (Blues in Japan), StarMan, NapalmMan, IceMan, ElecMan, PlantMan, KnightMan, ShadowMan, and Bass (Forte in Japan).
The particular Navis Capcom chose to make playable offer slight evidence that Real Operation was used as a testing ground for making Navis other than MegaMan playable in future Mega Man Battle Network titles, such as the appearance of NapalmMan, KnightMan, ShadowMan (who were all playable in Battle Network 5), Aqua, and Elec Man (playable in Battle Network 6)

Sabre Wulf,,2004,Rare Ltd.,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Sabre Wulf is a traditional platform game in which the player, as the safari adventurer Sabreman, runs and jumps between platforms to retrieve treasure guarded by the Sabre Wulf, who pursues Sabreman back to the start of the level. Sabreman last appeared in 1980s ZX Spectrum games including the original Sabre Wulf, in which he searched for pieces of an amulet used to tame the guardian Sabre Wulf. The 2004 revival extends this backstory, as the evil Dr. Dolittle-Goode steals the amulet and releases Sabre Wulf, who scares townspeople and steals treasure. As Sabreman, the player fights through eight worldsâeach consisting of a sequence of platforming levels and culminating in a laboratory levelâto retrieve an eighth of the amulet and return Sabre Wulf to captivity.[1] The player travels between levels using a village hub overworld[2] in which Sabreman can speak with inhabitants and prepare for the next raid.[3]
En route to the treasure, the player can also summon Sabreman's collectible creatures, who give the character special abilities needed to advance through the levels. For example, Sabreman use the bear's belly as a trampoline, the serpent as a platform, and an exploding creature as dynamite. The player can either find or purchase these creatures. The quicker the player reaches the level's object, the more valuable the treasure will be. For example, if the player delays, the gold treasure becomes silver or bronze.[4] When the player touches the treasure, Sabre Wulf begins to chase Sabreman, who must backtrack through the level to return the treasure to his tent without aid of the collectible creatures.[4] Since the wolf can outpace Sabreman, the player instead needs to recall both the structure of the map and outmaneuver the wolf.[1] If the wolf touches Sabreman, the player restarts from the beginning of the chase rather than the beginning of the level.[3] The game's difficulty does not increase evenly, and some consecutive levels will require the use of all collectible creatures while the next require none.[4] If the player completes a level with the gold treasure, a challenge mode version of the level unlocks with restrictions on time and helper creature selection.[1]
Sabre Wulf's humour is British and self-referential to the developer's history.[4] Some of Sabre Wulf's locations and characters reference games by Ultimate Play the Game, the company that preceded Rare.[3] The majority of the in-game speech is portrayed as murmurs similar to the characters in The Sims or Grabbed by the Ghoulies. Sabreman has several speech samples, such as ""run for it"" when Sabre Wulf starts to chase and ""smashing"" when finishing a level.[1] The player can save game progress in either of two save slots on the cartridge.[4]

The player ventures through the game's overworld in top-down perspective to fulfill two objectives: receive a star from each of the eight guardian gods living in the town to inaugurate the town's festive carnival, and invite as many people as possible to the carnival. The final goal of the game is to invite all 100+ characters of the game to the carnival, but only a portion of the characters can be invited during the first playthrough. Completion of the final goal requires at least three playthroughs of the game.
In preparing for the carnival, the player is faced with various puzzles or mysteries present within the town. The player can meet with local residents directly to receive items useful in solving the puzzles, or access the game's simulated internet using a PDA.[2] Relevant information can be gained through the web pages, emails, forums, chat rooms, and search engines simulated within the game. None of the puzzles and mysteries are difficult to solve, and few puzzles are presented during the first playthrough, allowing the player to get through to the carnival fairly easily. A fair portion of the game is spent as a tutorial, where the player learns the controls from supporting characters, and the game's dialogue and colorful style is directed towards casual gamers and young children.
The game also includes a mode where the player can create their own homepage viewable on the game's internet.

Samurai Deeper Kyo,,2008,Natsume,Bold Games,"NA, JP","Set in Tokugawa Japan, this manga begins by following Shiina Yuya, a bounty hunter searching for her brother's murderer.  However, Yuya quickly meets a medicine peddler named Mibu Kyoshiro, who turns out to be sharing a body with the feared samurai Demon Eyes Kyo.  Over time, Mibu Kyoshiro and, to a lesser extent, Shiina Yuya recede from the story while Demon Eyes Kyo comes to the fore.  Kyo's only stated wish is to regain his own body.  Following this path leads Kyo, Yuya and a variety of fellow travelers into conflict with both the Tokugawa shogunate and the Mibu tribe, a race of violent superhumans who have run Japan from the shadows for millennia.
Underlying the principal story arc of Kyo's search to reclaim his body, there are many smaller arcs, each leading to the next one. The basis of many later revelations are established many volumes in advance. In the manga, it is revealed that all of the Mibu, except for Kyo, are descendants of ""Battle Dolls"", creatures created by the Mibu to fight for their amusement. In time, the Battle Dolls come to believe they were the real Mibu, and that the real Mibu eventually became extinct due to in-fighting.  The Mibu Battle Dolls are gradually being killed by the ""Death Disease"". Muramasa's sister was the first to be killed by the disease, but others soon followed. The disease manifests itself when the infected person reaches a certain age. For this reason, the aging process has been stopped in Antera, Tokito, and probably others.
Demon Eyes Kyo ultimately defeats the father and creator of the Mibu, the Former Crimson King, who was also the very first Battle Doll. Originally an extremely beloved and thoroughly benevolent ruler, the King had become totally corrupted by his loss of all faith in humanity, and became an insane tyrant bent on completely eradicating all of mankind. Kyo then goes missing-in-action after the final battle, which blows up the Mibu capital. Kyo shows up at the end of the penultimate chapter being called upon by his sword tenro. In the bonus chapter which contains no dialogue shows Kyo and Yuya living in a house together.

The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause,,2006,1st Playable Productions,Buena Vista Games,,"Twelve years have passed since Scott Calvin took on the mantle of Santa Claus and married Carol Newman, who has now become a teacher in the North Pole. On Christmas Eve, she tells a group of young elves a story from her life with Scott while expecting their first child. Scott invites his in-laws, Sylvia and Bud Newman, to the North Pole, along with Scott's ex wife Laura, her husband Neil, their daughter Lucy, and Scott's son Charlie. Meanwhile, he is summoned to a meeting of the Council of Legendary Figures, consisting of Mother Nature, Father Time, the Easter Bunny, Cupid, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman, concerning the behavior of Jack Frost, who is jealous that he has no holiday or special occasion in his honor. Because he has been promoting himself during the Christmas season, Mother Nature suggests sanctions against him. As Scott is attempting to get the in-laws to come without revealing that he is Santa, Jack Frost negotiates a light sentence of community service at the North Pole, helping Scott and the elves put up various Canadian-themed paraphernalia, as Carol's parents believe Scott is a toy-maker in Canada; Scott consents.
However, Frost's ultimate goal is to trick Santa into renouncing his position. When elf Curtis inadvertently reveals the ""Escape Clause"", Frost sneaks into The Hall of Snow Globes and steals one containing Scott as Santa. If Scott holds the globe and says, ""I wish I'd never been Santa at all"", he will go back in time and undo his career as Santa. When Lucy discovers this, Frost freezes her parents and locks her in a closet. He then orchestrates situations that make Scott think he must resign to make things better.
Frost tricks Scott into invoking the Escape Clause and both are sent to Scott's front yard in 1994, when Scott caused the original Santa to fall off his roof and had to replace him. Frost causes the original Santa to fall off the roof and grabs Santa's coat before Scott can. Scott is sent back to the present day, where he has been CEO of his old company for the last twelve years and business takes priority over family. Scott also learns that Laura and Neil divorced and Carol moved away years ago.
Scott goes to find Lucy and Neil, who are vacationing at the North Pole, which Frost has turned into a theme park. Christmas is now ""Frostmas"", the elves are miserable, the reindeer are confined to a petting zoo, and parents can pay for their kids to be on the nice list. Scott finds Lucy and questions Neil about Laura; he states that Scottâs workaholic absence in Charlieâs life put all the pressure on Neil, and Charlie didn't want him to be his father, causing the divorce between him and Laura.
Scott confronts Frost and causes a distraction, while Lucy steals Frost's snow globe for him. Lucy throws the snow globe to Scott but Frost catches it. Scott plays a recording of Frost saying ""I wish I'd never been Santa at all"", invoking the Escape Clause, sending both Scott and Frost back to 1994. Scott restrains Jack long enough to let his 1994 counterpart get the coat, making him Santa Claus again, sending both back to the present in the original timeline.
Scott reconciles with his family and Jack is arrested by elf police. He reveals he cannot unfreeze his victims unless he unfreezes himself. Scott convinces Lucy via a snow globe he had given her earlier of her warmly hugging a snowman, to give Frost a ""magic hug"" to unfreeze and reform him. It works, Laura and Neil unfreeze and Frost becomes a new person. The ""Canada"" ruse is dropped and Scott appears as Santa to Carol's parents. With two hours remaining before Santa must leave for his Christmas deliveries, Carol goes into labor.
Months later, while Carol is telling the tale to her students, Scott walks in to reveal their baby boy, Buddy Claus.

Upon arriving, the gang meets Mondavarious, who claims the visiting tourists have been brainwashed. Velma attends a ritualistic performance hosted by N'Goo Tuana and his henchman, Zarkos, a famous luchador. N'Goo claims the island was once ruled by ancient demons that have been plotting their revenge ever since they were displaced by the resort.
In the resort's ghost ride, the gang splits up to look for clues. Fred and Velma come across a school designed to educate inhuman creatures about human culture, while Daphne discovers a pyramid-shaped artifact called the Daemon Ritus. The island's demons kidnap and possess Fred, Velma, Mondavarious and other tourists, and Zarkos possesses Daphne and steals the Daemon Ritus. Shaggy, in an underground chamber, finds a vat of protoplasm containing the souls of those possessed, and he frees those of his friends. Velma discovers that sunlight destroys the demons. They come across the voodoo priest, who explains that the demons, led by Mondavarious, will rule the world for the next ten thousand years if a pure soul is offered as a sacrifice during their ritual. Shaggy realizes that the pure soul is Scooby, who unwittingly accepts to be the sacrifice.
The gang plots to trap the demon cult, but it fails and only Daphne escapes capture. Mondavarious extracts Scooby's soul using the Daemon Ritus, but Shaggy breaks free and pushes Mondavarious aside, causing Scooby's soul to be released. Fred and Velma discover Mondavarious is actually a robot controlled by Scooby's estranged nephew Scrappy-Doo, who was abandoned by the gang years ago after his power-hungry nature got out of control. 
Using the tourists' souls, Scrappy transforms into a monster and tries to kill the gang. Daphne is attacked and captured by Zarkos again, but defeats him by kicking him into the ritual chamber, where he knocks over the vat and sets the souls free to return to their bodies. Daphne kills the demons by reflecting sunlight via a skull-shaped disco ball. Shaggy rips the Daemon Ritus from Scrappy's body to free the souls and finds the real Mondavarious imprisoned in a small underground cell, having been captured by Scrappy so he could pose as his double. Scrappy, N'Goo, Zarkos, and their minions are arrested while the reunited gang promises to continue solving mysteries together.

Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed,,2004,Altron,THQ,"NA, PAL","Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo attend the opening of an exhibition at the Coolsonian Criminology Museum commemorating their past solved cases with monster costumes on display. However, the event is interrupted by the Evil Masked Figure, who steals two costumes using the reanimated Pterodactyl Ghost. The entire gang is ridiculed by journalist Heather Jasper Howe, who starts a smear campaign against them. Concluding that an old enemy of theirs is the mastermind and seeking revenge, the gang begin revisiting old cases. Dismissing the former Pterodactyl Ghost, Doctor Jonathan Jacobo, due to his apparent death during a failed prison escape three years ago, they suspect Jeremiah Wickles, the Black Knight Ghost and Jacobo's cellmate who was recently released, as the culprit. Scooby and Shaggy, after overhearing the rest of the gang criticizing their tendency to bumble every operation, and especially their most recent offense in failing to secure the Pterodactyl Ghost at the museum, resolve to better themselves and act like real detectives.
Going to Wickles' mansion, the group fall through a trapdoor and into a cage targeting unwelcome callers, but escape with the aid of Daphne's cosmetics. Inside, the gang find an ancient Celtic text that serves as an instruction manual on how to create monsters through a combination of magic and science. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy find a note inviting Wickles to visit the Faux Ghost nightclub and are attacked by the Black Knight Ghost, but escape when Daphne fights him off while Velma discovers its weak spot and disables it. Before fleeing, the rest of the gang had previously discovered through the book found in Wickles' mansion that the key ingredient to creating the monsters was a substance called ""randomonium"", the byproduct of certain silver mines such as Coolsville's old mining town. Daphne, Velma and Fred go to the museum accompanied by the curator Patrick Wisely, but discover that the rest of the costumes have been stolen. Heather Jasper Howe turns the city against them.
Following the lead from Wickles' note, their first clue ever, Scooby and Shaggy sneak into the Faux Ghost wearing disguises to try and solve the mystery, only to discover it's a hangout for all the villains Mystery Inc. had unmasked in the past. After speaking to Wickles, they learn that he has abandoned his evil ways. Scooby goes dancing, but his disguise falls off and the two escape through a trash chute. On their way out, they spot Patrick uncharacteristically threatening someone who appears to be a member of his staff, ordering him to find answers to who vandalized his museum. Escaping an awkward interaction with Patrick, Scooby and Shaggy spot Wickles leaving the club and follow him. Daphne, Velma and Fred go to the mines, finding Wickles presenting plans to turn it into a summer camp for children to a group of investors. When they confront Wickles, he states that he and Jacobo hated each other for various petty reasons, and that he has no connection to the museum robberies.
The gang then find the Monster Hive, where the costumes are brought to life as real monsters. Shaggy and Scooby play around with the machine's control panel, accidentally bringing several costumes to life, and the gang flees with the panel as the Evil Masked Figure terrorizes the city. Escaping to their old high school clubhouse, the gang realizes that they can reverse the control panel's power by altering its wiring, destroying the monsters in the process. However, Captain Cutler's Ghost emerges from the nearby lake and forces the gang to head back to the mines, encountering the various monsters along the way. When Velma tries to give Scooby and Shaggy the control panel, they refuse to take it, believing that they will once again ruin everything and admit their feelings of inadequacy compared to the rest of the gang. Velma convinces them they are fine just the way they are and that they have both been heroes in their own way all along. After escaping the Skeleton Men, Velma finds a shrine dedicated to Jacobo built by Patrick. Eventually, Patrick finds her and proves his innocence by helping her after a catwalk gives way underneath her, but he is captured by the Pterodactyl Ghost.
The gang finally confronts the Evil Masked Figure as the Tar Monster captures everyone except Scooby, who uses a fire extinguisher to freeze the Tar Monster's body. He reconnects the control panel and activates it, turning the monsters back into costumes. The gang takes the Evil Masked Figure to the authorities, with Velma and Daphne unmasking them as Heather Jaspar Howe. When asked for Heather's motive for committing her crimes, Velma suddenly pulls Heather's face off, revealing her to actually be Johnathan Jacobo in disguise, who had survived his failed prison escape; Velma explains that she realised Jacobo was still alive after finding a newspaper clipping showing him in front of the museum, the construction of which had begun a year after his apparent death. Jacobo and his accomplice Ned are arrested and Mystery Inc. are praised as heroes once more. In the Faux Ghost, the gang celebrates their victory with the reformed criminals as the movie ends.

Scooby-Doo! Unmasked,,2005,Artificial Mind and Movement,THQ,"NA, PAL","The game opens with Scooby-Doo and the gang visiting Fred's cousin Jed at his special effects movie studio and factory Monstrous Fright and Magic or M.F.M., but once they get there, Jed is missing, and his animatronics have gone haywire. They find M.F.M. CEO Winslow Stanton and his assistant Marcy, who inform them Jed is responsible for sabotaging M.F.M. and has not only stolen some expensive animatronics but also a large supply of Mubber (a special compound used make animatronics into life-like special effects monsters). Scooby and the gang thus take it upon themselves to track down Jed and recover the stolen items. 
Their first stop is the local Chinatown, where they meet Maggie Xi, who warns them that the demonic sorcerer Zen Tuo has disrupted the local festival she is organizing before disappearing when a dragon roar is heard. Scooby finds clues and searches alleys, a sewer, a dojo, and a fortune cookie factory to track down Zen Tuo, save Shaggy and Daphne, and battle Zen Tuo's dragon in a kung fu costume made of Mubber. Zen Tuo turns out to be Xi in disguise, as Velma admits she gave it away when disappearing into the sewer entrance when they first met, using the dragon as a distraction. Maggie Xi cackles as her body disintegrates, revealing that she is one of the stolen animatronics, with a male voice coming through a hidden device telling the gang that they ""can't catch what they can't hold!"". Though Fred knows that the voice might be Jed, he remains in disbelief.
Velma tracks the signal from the device to the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Land amusement park where a man named Alvin Wiener informs the gang that a masked musician, the Guitar Ghoul, has scared off all the other guests. Scooby finds clues that tell of disturbing events (rides going havoc, animatronics chasing people, etc.). In time, Shaggy falls down a slide, promoting Scooby to save him. After a scare from the Guitar Ghoul, the two meet Nikki Starlight, who claims to be the Guitar Ghoul's girlfriend. Afterward, Daphne is trapped in a cage in a circus tent and is saved by Scooby in a new gliding costume. Regrouping, the Guitar Ghoul mocks the gang, as Scooby finds his location in a house of mirrors and defeats him. The Guitar Ghoul is revealed to be Alvin, as Velma reveals that he is really a failed musician who blamed the Guitar Ghoul for ruining his career. Nikki reveals herself as the real Guitar Ghoul, having done so to keep her private life secret. Velma tells Scooby to smell Alvin's costume, revealing it to be Mubber as Alvin admits he doesn't know the name of the person who gave him the suit. Nikki thanks the gang for saving her reputation and tells them to go to a private natural history museum where M.F.M. worked on some of the exhibits.
There, the gang learn that a Caveman haunts the museum and a pterodactyl takes Shaggy when he goes looking for food, promoting Scooby to save him again. Saving Shaggy, Scooby finds a large bone in the tar pit. Scooby later finds a contract from Stanton and gives it to Velma, as Fred and Daphne are trapped in a cage but are then freed by Scooby in his archer costume. The gang confronts the Caveman, defeating him. The Museum's head of security, Joseph Grimm, is revealed to be the Caveman as part of a scheme to sell the valuable petroleum deposits located under the Museum. Velma correctly deduces from this chain of events that Stanton is responsible for the thefts, having framed Jed and sent the gang on a wild goose chase to distract them.
The gang heads back to Monstrous Fright and Magic to confront Stanton, finding Jed stuffed inside a costume where Stanton trapped him when he learned of his plans. Stanton's voice is heard over a microphone, and he summons a giant Pterodactyl robot to battle them. Scooby defeats the Pterodactyl and reaches Stanton's location. The real Stanton appears behind the group; a UV light reveals that ""Stanton"" is Marcy in a Mubber disguise. Marcy tells them that she wanted revenge for Stanton taking all the credit on the creation of Mubber, which they both made together. Begging for forgiveness, Marcy and Stanton console and Stanton agrees to let her be a full partner in his company. The game ends with Shaggy making a Mubberwich (a sandwich with mubber); before he can eat it, Scooby uses the light to disintegrate it. Velma replies ""Now that's what I call a ""light"" snack!"" with the gang laughing, and another mystery solved.
","The player controls Scooby-Doo to defeat enemies, collect clues for Velma and ingredients for Shaggy, and solve the mystery. Scooby-Doo can change costumes in certain areas, which can give him different abilities such as kung-fu, gliding like a bat and archery with plungers.

Scurge: Hive,,2006,"Orbital Media, Inc.",SouthPeak Games,"NA, PAL","The story of Scurge: Hive follows Jenosa Arma, who has been contracted by the military on a rescue and salvage mission to Confederation Research Lab 58 on planet Inos. The perpetrator of the disaster is a virulent organism known as ""Scurge,"" a parasite which has the ability to transform various organisms and technologies into Scurge derivatives. Jenosa has been equipped with a suit that resists infection. Unfortunately, it can only slow the infection down rather than make her immune; she is infected with Scurge the moment she first encounters it. The story establishes an atmosphere that is highly detailed for a portable game. The ending leaves the door open for a sequel.
","Scurge: Hive is an action-adventure game that incorporates elements of many different games; Scurge emphasizes platforming elements, though the game's isometric vantage point makes jumps difficult to align. In addition to Jenosa's standard jump move, she can also attach a mechanical tether to a hook and swing longer distances, jump in mid air and grab onto horizontal pipes and ledges. The game's upgrade system allows the player to progressively open up more of the game world. Scattered throughout are simple puzzles. 
The game's isometric perspective and the inability to run while shooting puts the emphasis on aiming and risk-taking. Combat makes use of a rock-paper-scissors system, where a weapon will deal more damage to one type of enemy and powers up another. Jenosa will receive three elemental weapons: electromagnetic pulse, combustion and dissipate. EMP does more damage against mechanical enemies but increases the power of energy-based enemies; combustion works well against biological enemies but increases the strength of mechanical foes; dissipate effectively destroys energy foes but gives additional power to biological adversaries. Scurge: Hive frequently throws multiple enemies of different kinds at the player, forcing difficult decisions about which weapon to use.
Tying the game together is the game's infection meter. When the meter reaches 100%, Jenosa's health deteriorates rapidly. When her health reaches zero, she becomes a Scurge host. There are various cleansing stations (which also act as the game's save points) scattered about the game world that heal Jenosa. The result quickens the pace of the game.

Sega Rally Championship,,2003,Dice,Sega,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"The player can enter a ""World Championship"" mode consisting of three stages: Desert (which resembles African savanna), Forest (which resembles South American forests) and Mountain (which is based on a shortened Circuit de Monaco), where their finishing position at the end of one course is carried through to the starting position of the next course. In this mode, it is impossible to reach first-place position by the end of the first track; thus, the player must try to overtake as many opponent cars as possible on each track (while staying within the time limit), and gain the lead over several tracks. If, at the end of the third round, the player is in first place, they are able to play a fourth secret circuit called ""Lakeside"" (on the Saturn version, this course may then be played in time attack and split-screen multiplayer modes).
Three cars are featured in the game; Didier Auriol's third generation Toyota Celica GT-Four and Juha Kankkunen's Lancia Delta HF Integrale which are both available from the start, and Sandro Munari's Lancia Stratos HF which is unlocked by finishing Lakeside in first place in home versions of the game,[5] or by use of an easter egg in the arcade version.[6]  Players are given the option to drive each car in either manual or automatic transmission.[7]

Serious Sam Advance,No,2004,Climax Studios,Global Star Software,"NA, PAL","Serious Sam Advance begins with recounting how Sam ""Serious"" Stone returned from a time-travel mission to Abu Simbel in 2113. Scientists assessed the Time-Lock technology that Sam used to travel through time. Initially, they could only use it to send people to and from ancient Egypt but, in 2020, became able to control the time and place of travellers' destinations. Using this feature, agents were sent to various ancient civilisations to investigate whether Mentalâthe antagonist in the Serious Sam seriesâwas trying to release his horde on them to alter the course of history. This programme was successful for two years until three agents failed to return, as did the rescue team sent after them. Sam, the only survivor from previous encounters with Mental's forces, was thus selected to travel to ancient Rome in 512Â BCE.
Sam initially arrives in ancient Egypt at the Temple of Herkat and fights his way through enemies sent by Mental, crossing the desert and eventually encountering and defeating the Sirian Sphinx, one of Mental's more powerful minions. Sam enters a Time-Lock with the intent to return home, but Mental interferes and sends him to ancient Rome instead. He again defeats several waves of enemies and reaches Caesar's Palace. In it, Sam eliminates the Wolfinator, marking the end of Mental's attempt to rule over ancient Rome. Wishing to take a vacation on Maui, Sam enters a nearby Time-Lock to return home.
","Serious Sam Advance is a first-person shooter.[2][3] It contains twelve levels, each composed of enclosed rooms, often in the style of arenas.[2] Some levels contain puzzle elements. The player, as Sam ""Serious"" Stone, can freely navigate each room, using the D-pad for forward and backward movement and the shoulder buttons for strafing. Enemies patrol in rooms and attack Sam on sight. Entering a room or passing a trigger causes further enemies to appear and attack. There are twenty types of enemies in total.[3]
The player can attack using ten different weapons, including ranged weapons and a chainsaw for melee.[2][3] They can aim using the D-pad and fire the weapons using the ""A"" button. Holding down the button causes the weapons to fire continuously.[3] Aiming can be slowed down by holding the ""B"" button, while pressing the button once swaps the active weapon with another.[3][4] Enemies at close range are automatically targeted.[5] Ammunition can be collected through crates placed in levels.[3]
Serious Sam Advance contains no measures to save progress and uses a password system to let the player access later levels after a restart. A leaderboard documents the player's highscore, number of enemies encountered, and number of enemies killed, although that data is also not persisted.[2][3] Up to four players can connect their Game Boy Advance systems using the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable and compete in a deathmatch mode.[2]"

Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon|Shining Force: Kuroki Ryuu no FukkatsuJP,,2004,Amusement Vision,Atlus,"NA, PAL, JP","The game opens in the Kingdom of Guardiana, in the land of Rune. The protagonist, Max, is sent on a mission to prevent the evil Kane, who commands the hordes of Runefaust, from opening the Shining Path and resurrecting Dark Dragon. Along the way, Max recruits a number of allies to join the Shining Force. They eventually find that both Kane and King Ramladu are under the control of the manipulative Darksol. Darksol ultimately succeeds in reviving Dark Dragon, but Max seals the creature away using the power of the Chaos Breaker, a sword created by merging a sword of light with Kane's sword of darkness.[5]
","Shining Force is a turn-based tactical role-playing game. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, do not count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.
As is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels.
In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no ""generic"" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.
Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.
Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.
Shining Force also possesses an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle.

Shining Soul,,20022003,Nex Entertainment,Atlus,"NA, PAL, JP","The game takes place in the land of Rune, where a creature named Dark Dragon has gathered an army of Darkness in an attempt to bring about the destruction of the world. Your character is a hero of the Shining Fleet, which has trapped Dark Dragon and its five generals in the region of Runefaust and is now preparing to make a final assault on the enemy forces.[7]
","It contains four main classes (Warrior, Archer, Dragonute, or Wizard) and several dungeons that involve hack and slash style fighting. The player can cycle between magic and weapons based attacks. As you progress through the game and gain levels, you're able to allocate points for your main stats, like strength and dexterity, as well as distribute skill points. Skill points allow you to raise weapon and magic proficiency levels and to raise the levels of other abilities that are class-specific, such as defense for the warrior, critical hits for the archer, and so on.[8]
"
Shining Soul II,,20032004,Nex Entertainment,Atlus,"NA, PAL, JP","Shining Soul II has little connection to the storyline of the rest of the series aside from a reference to the events of Shining Soul in the introduction. However, an alternate universe version of Boken from Shining Force appears as a major NPC, traditional Shining mascot Yogurt is hidden in one of the stages, and a number of dungeons from the original Shining Soul appear as short hidden dungeons.[1]
Centuries after the defeat of Dark Dragon in Shining Soul, light had become too strong, opening the way to a resurgence of darkness. A crystal in the possession of King Marcel and Queen Yvonne of Klantol, which throughout the story reflects the current balance of light and darkness, turns from shining to cloudy. An alchemist named Gillespie, a member of a dark order, the Chaos Knights, worms his way into the friendship of King Marcel's most trusted knight, Deatharte. Gillespie then disappears, leaving something called ""the forbidden fruit"" with Deatharte. Driven by curiosity, Deatharte eventually eats the fruit and is corrupted by darkness.
Later, a tournament at the Klantol Colosseum is interrupted by news that Princess Camille has been abducted. King Marcel orders Deatharte to search for her. Deatharte pretends to obey, but instead goes to join the Chaos Knights. Since Marcel is also concerned about an army of goblins mustering near the castle, he sends a promising young participant in the tournament (the player character) to investigate. Penetrating the goblin fort, the young hero not only confirms that the goblins were planning an attack on the castle, but learns that they abducted Camille and delivered her to the evil witch Wizari, who plans to sacrifice her to increase her power. The hero defeats the goblins and recovers the key to Camille's prison. Since Deatharte has naturally still not returned, Marcel relies upon the young hero to journey to Wizari's palace and save Camille. He succeeds in doing this and slaying Wizari.
The celebration is short-lived, as normally peaceful beings are driven mad by darkness. The hero's investigations of these incidents takes him to the mainland of Klantol, where he uncovers a plot by the Chaos Knights to conquer the world. Meanwhile, Princess Camille sneaks away to find Gillespie and manages to learn the password to the Chaos Knights' hidden stronghold. She is later trapped in Koldazhek Cave, but is rescued by the hero and tells him the password. Infiltrating the Chaos Knights' stronghold, the hero slays both Gillespie and Deatharte, who had become leader of the Chaos Knights.
The defeat of the Chaos Knights, however, causes a violent shift in balance from darkness to light, awakening a destructive power called Chaos, which even the forces of darkness fear. Marcel, Yvonne, Camille, and the court wizard are spirited away by Chaos. A former knight guides the hero to a passage to Chaos's realm. The hero goes there and defeats Chaos, rescuing the four prisoners and restoring balance to the world.
","The game features eight character classes which can be improved up to level 200. Each is customisable with a variety of weapons, spells, support abilities, and attributes. Different classes who can use the same weapons attack differently with them. For example, the Warrior's spear attack is a thrust, while the Archer throws his spear over a distance.  Each usable spell in the game has its own spellbook, and only classes with that spell on their skills list can use the spellbook to cast the spell.
Each character is able to equip up to three weapons and three items for use, and switch between them at any time. The player can get 3 extra slots for either by equipping the Backpack or Knapsack. Attacks are performed by tapping the attack button, or holding to charge a more powerful attack. Beyond regular equipment, a ""Soul"" item can also be equipped; it is charged by defeating enemies, and unleashed to inflict massive damage on nearby enemies. They come in various elemental types and levels of effectiveness. They are graded on the Roman numerals I, II, III, IV and V, with V being the strongest and taking the longest to charge up.
Characters also have resistances to a number of elements: Fire, Ice, Thunder, Light, Dark and Poison. These can be raised by equipment, but also through endurance: by taking damage of a particular elemental kind, they can increase their resistance to it, but being killed by an attack of that type will decrease the resistance level by a point.
The multiplayer is very similar to that of Diablo. The player characters navigate the dungeon and attack monsters. Players can give items to each other by throwing or dropping them. The party can only move to the next area when every player character has either passed the exit point of the current area or died. Opening the inventory window does not pause the game (in singleplayer or multiplayer), so some players can reorganize their inventory while others engage in combat. Some classes are more useful in multiplayer, such as the priestess or archer.

In ""Slammageddon"", each single attack counts as a Slam.
Every character's ""Slam"" attack have different effects and range. For example, Shrek's ""Green Storm"" attack will send his opponents flying as he undergoes flatulence at close range, while Robin Hood's ""Arrow Swarm"" has him commanding his band of Merry Men to litter the battlefield in raining arrows from the sky.

Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface (text and illustrations) shown before each level.

The game is broken into different chapters, each with its own set of goals. One chapter requires the player to make sure three blind mice safely make their way to the witch's house. Other chapters have the player acting as a deputy in Far, Far Away Landâcollecting bits of Humpty Dumpty, stealing treasure from a troll, helping the police clear out rioting hooligans from the streets, escorting Cinderella while she window-shops for a glass slipper, ridding the town of the Pied Piper's rat infestation, collecting chickens for a stew, or battling Puss in Boots via timed button presses.[1]
Players play mini-games when they are not traveling on hazardous paths from point A to point B. Challenges that require the player's entire party include having to punch chickens into cook pots or a pen, escorting characters through a stage (Billy Goat Gruff and the three blind mice), and collecting fairies, jewels, etc.[1]

After an enemy has sustained several hits, a finishing move can be used on them, which, when activated, plays an animation of the currently selected character finishing off the enemy, defeating them instantly, as well as causing them to drop special purple fairy dust. Felled enemies will drop fairy dust that will fill up the three-part special attack meter.
There are 6 minigames in Shrek the Third. Playing them does not affect the main game (that is, no bonus Far Far Pounds are awarded). By obtaining a high enough score after each game (the amount varies depending on the game), three different medals are awarded; bronze, silver and gold (in order from lowest to highest).

Sigma Star Saga,,20052006,WayForward,Namco,"NA, PAL",NaN,"There are two distinct portions of the game: an overworld where the player control Recker directly, and side-scrolling shooter random battles.
In the overworld, Recker travels around either talking to people to advance the plot or searching for items and data on one of several planets. As the game progresses, his abilities expand: he is given more weapons to fight the local flora and fauna, and he receive power-ups that lets him pass different barriers to his progress.
As the player traverse the various planets, they are frequently transported into space to pilot the Krill defense fleet surrounding each planet. The ships are biological in nature and semiautonomous: they only require a pilot when they sense danger. In most battles, the player are required to shoot down a certain number of enemies to end the sequence.
The ship battles are where the RPG elements of the game come in: as the player kill enemies, they drop experience bubbles, which power up the offensive and defensive capabilities. The player can further increase their abilities through the Gun Data system.
Unlike many shooters, there is no need to have a fixed ship in this game. The player are transported to a different ship in one of half a dozen classes, chosen randomly by the game. In some battles they will fly a small, agile attack ship, in some a bomber, and in some a lumbering cargo vessel.
The Gun Data system allows the player to customize how their ship fires its weapons. There are three categories that can be changed: cannon, bullet, and impact. The cannon alters the direction and manner in which the bullets fire (forwards, backwards, rapid fire, etc.), Bullet alters the shot type (large, long-range, chargeable, etc.), and Impact determines what the bullet does when it hits an enemy (explodes, drops health, etc.). The game includes dozens of different options for each data, mostly found by exploration in the overworld. The total number of combinations is 15,680, although only one can be used in any given battle.

SimCity 2000,No,2003,Full Fat,Destination Software,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The unexpected and enduring success of the original SimCity, combined with the relative lack of success with other ""Sim"" titles, finally motivated the development of a sequel. SimCity 2000 was a major extension of the concept. It had a near-isometric dimetric view (similar to the earlier Maxis-published A-Train)[5] instead of overhead, land could have different elevations, and underground layers were introduced for water pipes and subways.
New types of facilities include prisons, schools, libraries, museums, marinas, hospitals and arcologies. Players can build highways, roads, bus depots, railway tracks, subways, train depots and zone land for seaports and airports. There are a total of nine varieties of power plants in SimCity 2000, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams (which can only be placed on waterfall tiles), solar and the futuristic fusion power and satellite microwave plant. Most types of power plants have a limited life span and must be rebuilt periodically. Players can build highways to neighboring cities to increase trade and the population.
The budget and finance controls are also much more elaborateâtax rates can be set individually for residential, commercial and industrial zones. Enacting city ordinances and connecting to neighboring cities became possible. The budget controls are very important in running the city effectively.
Another new addition in SimCity 2000 is the query tool. Using the query tool on tiles reveals information such as structure name and type, altitude, and land value. Certain tiles also display additional information; power plants, for example, display the percentage of power being consumed when queried, and querying roads displays the amount of traffic on that tile. Querying a library and selecting ""Ruminate"" displays an essay written by Neil Gaiman.[6]
Graphics were added for buildings under construction in the residential, commercial, and industrial zones, as well as darkened buildings depicting abandoned buildings as a result of urban decay.
News comes in the form of several pre-written newspaper articles with variable names that could either be called up immediately or could be subscribed to on a yearly basis. The newspaper option provided many humorous stories as well as relevant ones, such as new technology, warnings about aging power plants, recent disasters and opinion polls (highlighting city problems). SimCity 2000 is the only game in the entire series to have this feature (besides the discontinued children's version, SimTown), though newer versions have a news ticker. The newspapers had random titles (Times, Post, Herald, etc.), and prices based on the simulated year. Certain newspapers have a special monthly humor advice column by ""Miss Sim"". Some headlines have no purpose whatsoever in the game, such as ""Bald Radio Found"" or ""Frog Convention"".
Though there is no ""true"" victory sequence in SimCity 2000, the ""exodus"" is a close parallel. An ""exodus"" occurs during the year 2051 or later, when 300 or more Launch Arcologies are constructed; the following January each one ""takes off"" into space so that their inhabitants can form new civilizations on distant worlds.[7] This reduces the city's population to those who are not living in the Launch Arcologies, but it also opens wide areas for redevelopment and returns their construction cost to the city treasury. This is related to the event in SimEarth where all cities are moved into rocket-propelled domes that then leave to ""found new worlds"" (leaving no sentient life behind).
The game also included several playable scenarios, in which the player must deal with a disaster (in most, but not all scenarios) and rebuild the city to meet a set of victory conditions. These were based in versions of real-life cities, and some were based on real events such as the Oakland firestorm of 1991, the 1989 Hurricane Hugo in Charleston, South Carolina, the Great Flood of 1993 in Davenport, Iowa, or dealing with the 1970s economic recession in Flint, Michiganâbut also included more fanciful ones such as a ""monster"" destroying Hollywood in 2001. More scenarios added with the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK) included a nuclear meltdown in Manhattan in 2007.

The Sims 2,,2005,Maxis,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL",NaN,"From the neighborhood view, the player selects one lot to play, as in The Sims.[9] There are both residential and community lots, but Sims can only live in residential lots. Sims can travel to Community lots in order to purchase things like clothing and magazines, and to interact with NPCs and townies. This feature was only included in this game.
The player can choose between playing a pre-made inhabited lot, moving a household into an unoccupied pre-built lot, or constructing a building on an empty lot. One novelty from The Sims is foundations.
The player switches among the ""live"" mode (default) to control Sims, the ""buy"" mode to add, move or delete furniture, or the ""build"" mode to rebuild the house. Buy and build mode cannot be accessed when on a community lot, but can be opened by using the neighborhood view. It is also possible to import neighborhood terrains from SimCity 4.[10]
The game contains some time-bound social challenges that provide a reward if successful. Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school.[9] Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in University or dating in Nightlife. In Nightlife, each date is a challenge to keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, PlantSims, and Witches.
The main part of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby several times. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) pregnant before giving birth to a baby.[9] During Pregnancy, the belly does not expand gradually. Instead, every day, it ""pops"" to a bigger size. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling adoption service on the phone, even by single parents, old age sims or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a teenager, and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an elder. An elder will eventually die; the length of this final stage depends on the aspiration bar when they become an elder.
Babies, toddlers, children, teens, and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the ""Grow Up"" self-interaction. If the University expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Aging can be disabled via cheats.
Players will need to build up talent badges, skills and relationships with other people, so that they can be successful in their career.[11] A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives).
Pregnancy, toddlers, teens, and elders are new stages of life. Young adult is a unique age added with the University expansion. Teen Sims will become young adults once they are moved to a University, and will be adults once they leave campus, regardless of the reason.
In The Sims 2, Create a Family is entered by clicking the ""Families"" button in the lower left-hand corner of the neighborhood view, then clicking the large ""Create New Family"" button. Clicking the button labeled ""Create A Sim"" will expand a tab which has the ""Create a Sim"" and ""Make a Child"" icons. ""Make a Child"" will be grayed out unless the family contains an adult male and adult female. Clicking the ""Create a Sim"" icon will generate a random adult Sim, who may be male or female which can be edited by the player.
As opposed to The Sims, any age besides baby or young adult (which must be made in the University Create a Student) may be created. Instead of having to choose from already finished faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, etc.) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. There are ten personality traits which are: sloppy, neat, shy, outgoing, lazy, active, serious, playful, grouchy, and nice but only 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits.[12] However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each zodiac sign. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim. A sim also has one of six Aspirations which is a lifetime goal that strongly influences their Wants and Fears which are: Grow Up, Romance, Family, Knowledge, Popularity, and Fortune.
The Sims 2 also comes with The Sims 2 Body Shop, which enables users to create genetics, makeups, accessories, clothes, and Sims, with the help of third-party tools, such as MS Paint, Paint.NET, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Wings 3D, and SimPE.
There are several new social interactions introduced in The Sims 2. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim's personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions.
There are careers that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion.[16] Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards creates rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.[17]
Graphically, The Sims 2 is more detailed than The Sims and lets players view its world in full 3D. This is a change from earlier Sim games, such as SimCity 2000, which used dimetric projection and fixed resolutions, as the camera was in The Sims. In The Sims, Sims are 3D meshes, but The Sims 2 introduces far more detail in mesh quality, texture quality, and animation capability. A Sim's facial features are customizable and unique, and Sims can smile, frown, and blink. The player can adjust a Sim's features in the in-game Create-a-Sim tool; for example, noses can be made to be very large or very small. Texturing is achieved through use of raster images, though it appears more lifelike.
The Sims 2 characters pass through seven life stages â babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with University), adults, and elders â with eventual death of old age, while babies in The Sims only become children before ceasing to age further. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to The Sims 2. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits as opposed to The Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics play a major role in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.
Some of the other additions to gameplay are career rewards, a week cycle, the cleaning skill (which was a hidden skill in The Sims), a variety of meals (depending on time of day), exercise clothing, body shape affected by diet and exercise, and houses built on foundations.
As known, this game had many mysteries, Easter eggs and neighbourhood stories, the most interesting and well-known being of Bella Goth's disappearance to Strangetown where her memory is erased.
Cutscenes were another new feature in The Sims 2. There are cutscenes featuring first kiss, woohoo, child birth, alien abductions, also going to college and graduating in The Sims 2: University.

The Sims Bustin' Out|The SimsJP,,2003,Maxis,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"In the console version, Malcolm Landgraab is going around his neighborhood, stealing items in return for unpaid rent. The player's objective is to complete each career track, unlock and buy back everyone's many possessions, and become rich enough to evict Malcolm from his mansion and move their own Sim in.
The Game Boy Advance and N-Gage version puts the player's Sim in a place called ""SimValley"" for summer holiday. Like the console version, GBA/N-Gage version gameplay is objective-based â every time the player completes a series of tasks, the game is allowed to progress. In this game, there are no furnishing objects to unlock. Instead, the player must complete all tasks to unlock new houses.
Deviating from the ""point-and-click"" selection process heretofore used in every Sims title, this version allows the user to control their Sim directly, using the GBA's directional pad.
In both versions, there are various locations that Sims may visit throughout the course of the game. As Sims advance through the game, new areas become accessible. In the GBA version, new mini-games may be unlocked in certain areas. In the N-Gage version, new mini-games (jobs for the Sims) are unlocked progressively when certain tasks are done. Also, Sims can collect three cartridges from various locations and play classic games such as Snakes on the Sims' mobile phones that would not be available again until The Sims 3.

The Sims 2: Pets,,2006,Maxis,Electronic Arts,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Sims can own cats, dogs, birds and gerbils. Pets features 75 pre-made breeds of dogs and thirty pre-made breeds of cats. Create-A-Pet is similar to ""Create-a-Sim"", where a user builds a human Sim characters. In Create-a-Pet, players may customize a cat or dog by choosing patterns and colors of coat, body shape, facial structure, and personality, which determines playfulness, neatness, loyalty, aggression, and intelligence.
Pets have motives like their Sim counterparts. Sims and pets are similar except for the absence of the ""Room"" motive, which ""Scratching"" replaces in cats and ""Chewing"" in dogs. Sims may also train their pets to do various tricks.
Pets can follow one of three career paths: Security, Showbiz and Services. When pets get promoted, various pet-related ""unlockables"" are made available along with a code so players can share these items with others.
Pets have three life stages: Puppy/Kitten, Adult, and Elder. The length of a pet's elder hood is selected at random, however there is an aspiration reward object which will extend the pet's life by a few days with each use.
Pets are able to breed, and doing so will produce a litter. The number of puppies or kittens is dependent on the number of Sims and pets currently in the house. Players can play with up to eight Sims or six pets at one time, although one can only have a total of six Sims and/or pets in a household altogether.[5]
Pets can be trained to do various tricks, and they can be scolded or praised. The tricks include sit, stay, shake, come here, guard, roll over, sing, and more. In the Nintendo Game Boy Advance version, they can be taught to stand up on two legs and juggle, or other unusual tricks. When the pet learns a new trick, it adds to the Sim and pet relationship. If the pet does something bad, it is able to be scolded. There are a few unpleasant acts: pets may relieve themselves where it is inappropriate, dig up the yard, chew up the newspaper or floor, scratch up furniture, or dig out the trash. It is helpful to praise a pet after it has done something favorable. It can also be given a treat after praising it to do the favorable action or completing a trick.
Werewolves are a type of supernatural creature which the Sim can interact with or even be transformed into. Sims exist as Werewolves only during night hours. During these hours, the werewolf's energy will go up, but their hunger will decrease more quickly as well. A Werewolf can teach a pet faster than humans and can fight against burglars. They might occasionally howl at the moon, howl at player's command, or howl to summon wolves.
To become a werewolf, players must build up a relationship with any wolf with glowing eyes (the werewolf pack leader). The pack leader will eventually ""nibble"" the Sim it was interacting with, causing it to become a werewolf. Once a Sim has become a werewolf they may ""savage"" another Sim to turn them into a werewolf. Werewolves are not featured on the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube or Wii versions.
There are many new songs that appear in the original Pop radio station from the base game in this game that have been converted in Simlish:
Locales other than US English contain more songs:
These songs are not played in other locales (including US English), but they can be extracted from the game resources.[citation needed]

Sister Princess: Re Pure,,2003,,Marvelous Entertainment,JP,NaN,"The premise behind Sister Princess is that an ordinary young man (the player) is made to live with twelve lovable little sisters, each with their own distinct quirks and personalities. The game itself plays out like a dating sim. Players have about a month to spend with the sisters with each day broken up into three segments: first is the free time period before noon, followed by the period after lunch and ending with another period of time before bed. During day time, the player can choose which of the girls he wishes to escort to school, if any. The period after lunch is similar to the one in the morning, with additional choices which allow the player to go to various places in town besides walking home with one of the girls. Every night before bed, the player will be allowed to check his e-mail and send replies. As the player continues to interact with the sisters, their reactions to their big brother will change accordingly until the ending.
There are two different endings for each sister: the normal ending and the ""non-blood relation"" ending. As the name would suggest, the special ending reveals that the brother-character and sister are not actually related by blood. In the case of some of the older sisters, this can lead to the protagonist and ""sister"" marrying one another. In the original Sister Princess, the player can see two different endings for each sister, but Sister Princess 2 has four endings for each sister. The first two were the non-sibling relation and siblings-together ending and, if the player chooses one sister in the beginning but ends up with another sister, either of the other two endings for the first sister who the player does not choose appear (""non-blood relation"" ending and ""still brother and sister forever"" ending also) but with a different story.
For Sister Princess 2, the story begins on the final day of school before summer vacation. Then the player chooses a sister who he wants to start with for a close relationship. Therefore, Sister Princess 2 is about spending the player's time with either one sister or all sisters at the same time as they spend their summer together. Especially in Sister Princess 2, the player can spend the summer with all the sisters, not just one, in a special ending where the sisters invite their brother to a summer party where the brother and the sisters would swear to be together forever.

The game is divided into four difficulties, each of which contains three different levels (with the exception of ""Dusk and Wired"", which only contains one). If the player manages to beat the rival cab in all three levels of a difficulty, they are taken to a bonus stage with the only available route being all of the Risky Routes. At the end of a stage, the player's score is based on the amount of time it took to reach the destination, the cab's condition, the rival being beaten, the number of Turbo powerups obtained, and the number of Risky Routes traversed. Unlike many racing games, the horn actually has a functional use of making (most) mobile vehicles move aside. If the player runs out of time before completing the stage, they encounter a continue screen. A 10-second countdown will be then given to the player if they wish to try again. After it expires, the game is over. However, on the console version's Head-to-Head mode, there is no continue feature. After time runs out, the game automatically ends.

Snood,,2001,Rebellion,Destination Software,"NA, PAL",NaN,"The pieces in the game are called Snoods. There are seven regular Snoods and four Special Snoods. The regular Snoods are Jake (Blue), Midoribe (Green), Mildred (Grey), Spike (Purple), Zod (Red), Geji (Light blue), and Sunny (Yellow).
Each turn, the player launches a Snood of randomly selected color into the playfield. If the Snood lands adjacent to two or more Snoods of the same color, all connecting Snoods of that color vanish and any pieces left unattached beneath the vanished Snoods drop down. The player's score increases with the number of Snoods eliminated. With each Snood launched, a danger meter increases and when it reaches the top, all the Snoods in play lower a level. If the Snoods drop past the lowest level of the playing field, the game is over. Releasing Snoods reduces the ""Danger Meter.""
The first special Snood is called Numbskull. Numbskull is shaped like a human skull and is the one type of Snood that is never launched into play, which means it cannot be joined with other Snoods. If Numbskulls are found at the start of a level, they will have to be isolated and dropped by the player to remove them from the board. If the player loses the game, all the Snoods will turn into Numbskulls, serving as a visual game over message.
The other three special Snood pieces may be launched, and appear at random (and infrequently). One is called Stone which is round and gray, and will always knock out the Snoods adjacent to where it lands. Another is called Wildcard which appears to cycle through all of the regular Snoods and may be used in place of any of them. The last is called Rowbuilder, a diamond-shaped creature which will fill one row horizontally with like regular Snoods. In the registered game, users may control how frequently these special Snoods appear.
The premise is simple. Unlike Bust a Move, there is no conventional time limit in Snood modes other than Time Attack; however, players must eliminate Snoods efficiently enough to prevent the gradually descending ceiling from crushing them. Many levels also require Snoods to be ricocheted off of walls in order to get them in the appropriate spot, which can be tricky. Snood requires considerable skill at approximating angles as well as strategy.

Sonic Advance,Yes (SPM),2001,Sonic Team,Sega / THQ,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Sonic Advance is a side-scrolling platformer action game reminiscent of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis.[1] Players journey through an island to defeat Doctor Eggman, who is attempting to capture its animal population to turn them into evil robots. Players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Sonic the Hedgehog is fastest and can perform an ""insta-shield"" that protects him for a moment; Tails can fly or swim for a short time; Knuckles the Echidna can glide through the air, swim above water for a few seconds and climb walls; and Amy Rose can destroy enemies using a hammer.[2] Except for Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a cheat code, players can control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992).[3]
The game takes place over six levels called zones. Each zone is split into two acts, where the player must guide their selected character past enemies and obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits to reach the end in under ten minutes. Scattered around acts are springboards, boost pads, and golden rings, which serve as a form of health; players survive hits as long as they have at least one ring, but their rings will scatter and disappear after a short period.[1] Players collect canisters that contain power-ups such as speed shoes, elemental shields, and invincibility.[3] The first act ends when players pass a signpost, and the second culminates in a boss fight with Eggman; after hitting him eight times, Eggman will flee and drop a capsule of captured animals. Each character starts the game with a number of lives, which are lost when they are hit with no rings in their possession, crushed, drown, fall in a bottomless pit, or exceed an act's 10-minute limit. If all lives are lost, they will receive a game over.[1]
Special springs can be found near the top of certain acts.[2] By jumping on them, the player can reach a special stage, where they are sent down a tube to collect rings. If they collect enough rings, the player receives a Chaos Emerald.[1] Collecting all seven Emeralds unlocks an extra boss fight. The game also features a minigame, Tiny Chao Garden, where players can raise Chao.[4] Players can transfer their Chao between the Tiny Chao Garden and the Chao Garden from the GameCube versions of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2.[2] The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode, where up to four owners of the game can race to the end of a level or search for Chao.[4]

Sonic can perform an ""insta-shield"" that protects him for a brief moment; Cream and Tails can fly; Knuckles can glide and climb; and Amy can destroy enemies using a hammer.[1]

If the player is hit by an enemy and has no rings, they lose a life.[5] A character will also lose a life if they fall into a gap, get crushed, or exceed an act's 10-minute limit. The game ends when all lives are lost. The player can also collect seven ""special rings"" to access special stages,[5] where Chaos Emeralds are found. Special stages are on a 3D plane,[3] where the character tries to obtain a set number of rings before time runs out in order to collect a Chaos Emerald. After beating all zones and finding all seven Chaos Emeralds with Sonic, an alternate final act is unlocked.[2]
When all of the Chaos Emeralds are collected with the other characters, a sound test feature (where the player can listen to music) and a boss time-attack feature are unlocked, along with the Tiny Chao Garden, where toys for Cheese,[1] can be purchased with rings earned in-game.[5] Various mini-games can also be played in the Tiny Chao Garden.[6] Other game modes include a ""time-attack"" mode where the player tries to beat a specific act in the shortest amount of time,[7] and a multiplayer mode, where players can race each other through unlocked acts.[3]

Sonic Advance 3,Yes (SPM),2004,Sonic Team / Dimps,Sega / THQ,"NA, PAL, JP","Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman builds a robotic assistant[15] named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who was destroyed in Sonic Battle.[16] Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.[15]
The final boss fight takes place at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall off the edge of the temple. Peace is restored to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.
","Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player controls one of five characters simultaneously with a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump through a series of seven levels, destroying robots along the way.[3] The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. If a character takes damage while carrying no rings, they lose a life. The team will also lose a life if they drown underwater, get crushed by a moving object, fall into a bottomless pit, or exceed an act's ten-minute limit. Losing a life will make the team start over from the beginning of the act or from the last passed checkpoint. If all lives are lost, the player receives a game over.[4]
The levels contain features like vertical loops, springs, and rails that the player can grind on. Each level is divided into three acts, punctuated by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman at the end; all three acts, the boss fight, and two minigames that grant the player extra lives are bound by a hub world.[5] Within each act, the player collects Chao creatures;[3] finding 10 in all 3 acts in one zone grants the player access to a special stage, where a Chaos Emerald can be found. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds, which can be done after completion of the main campaign, allows the player to fight an extra final boss for the game's true ending.[6]
The player can select any two-member permutation of its five playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, and Cream the Rabbit, provided the two desired characters have been unlocked; only Sonic and Tails are available at the beginning, while the other three must be rescued from Eggman over the course of the game.[3] Each character has a unique ability: Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid-air,[7] Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller,[8] Amy can smash enemies with her hammer,[9] Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls,[10] and Cream can fly using her ears as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend, Cheese.[11] The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button;[12] for example, pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air.[13] In addition, the second character will collect rings and destroy enemies the first has not.[3] Outside the main game, there are two battle modes for two to four players, in which any of the characters can be selected: racing and Chao collecting.[14]

Sonic Battle,Yes (SPM),2004,Sonic Team,Sega / THQ,"NA, PAL, JP","While studying the diary of his grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman learns of an artifact Gerald had unearthed: a 4000-year-old sentient weapon called the Gizoid created by an ancient civilization. Eggman attempts to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, but is unsuccessful and abandons it at Emerald Beach. Sonic the Hedgehog finds the Gizoid, which activates and develops a link with him after Sonic demonstrates his abilities.
The Gizoid, which Sonic names Emerl due to its ability to use the Chaos Emeralds, demonstrates an ability to perfectly replicate any moves it sees and quickly gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic's friends, allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Tails, Rouge, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, and Shadow, Emerl learns of the world and of concepts like friendship. As they train together, the group discovers that Emerl becomes stronger and develops more sentience with each Chaos Emerald that he obtains, and begin searching for the remaining Emeralds to help the robot develop. While searching, they are repeatedly attacked by the forces of Eggman, who now wants to retrieve the weapon, including a rebuilt E-102 Gamma and a series of imperfect Emerl duplicates under the name ""E-121 Phi"".
Eventually, all the Chaos Emeralds are obtained and Emerl achieves full sentience. In a last attempt, Eggman decides to lure Emerl onto his new Death Egg to capture him. The two battle, and Emerl emerges victorious, but Eggman uses his new Final Egg Blaster to force Emerl to override his link with Sonic with Eggman's own. However, this overloads Emerl, deleting his personality and causing him to go haywire. The rogue Gizoid then turns the blaster towards the planet, and Sonic is sent to stop him before the world is destroyed. Sonic defeats Emerl, who briefly reverts to his previous personality and bids his friends farewell before overloading with energy and exploding, leaving the shards of the Chaos Emeralds he acquired behind. Sonic returns home to his friends, who are saddened by the loss of Emerl. When asked if he believes Emerl is truly gone, Sonic reassures everyone that they will see him again someday.
","Battles are fought in 3D arenas with up to four players. Each character has a set of attacks and abilities. The majority of attacks are used with B, including the combo (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Attack), Air Attack, Upper Attack (used to knock opponents straight up), Heavy Attack (used to knock opponents away), and Aim Attack (used to pursue an opponent after the Heavy Attack). The A button is used to jump, and the L button lets the player block attacks, or heal damage if the button is held. The playable characters also have unique special moves, the three types being Shot, Power, and Set. Shot moves center around using a projectile to damage the opponent from a distance. Power moves focus on dealing damage quickly in a single move. Trap moves generally involve using a type of bomb to surprise-attack the enemy. However, only a limited number of special moves can be selected. Shot, Power, and Trap must be allocated to three slots: Ground, Air, and Defend. The special move you set to Ground will be used when you press R on the ground. The move you set to Air will be used when you press R in mid-air. The last slot, Defend, has a different function; When a player sets a certain type of special move to Defend, then every time an enemy uses the same type of special move set to Defend to attack, it will automatically be blocked.[2]
Each player has two vital stats, a health bar and an Ichikoro Gauge. When health is completely depleted, the player is KO'd and loses one life (in a survival match) or the one who KO'd them gets a point (in a KO match). The Ground, Air, and Defend settings are chosen at the beginning of the match, and every time the player respawns. As a player takes damage, blocks attacks, or heals, the Ichikoro Gauge fills up. When it is full, the next special move the player does will instantly KO anyone it hits. However, if they chose to defend against that type of special, or successfully block, their Ichikoro Gauge will be filled instantly. Players healing damage will also slowly fill up their Ichikoro Gauge, but are still vulnerable to attacks.
The main playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles ""Tails"" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, Cream the Rabbit, E-102 Gamma, and Chaos (E-102 Gamma and Chaos are not playable in Story Mode, but they are playable in Battle Mode and Challenge Mode when you unlock them in the Story Mode), as well as the original character Emerl, whose Skill Copy allows players to teach him different fighting abilities throughout the game.
The game includes five mini-games. The only mini-game available at the beginning of the game is ""Soniclash"", in which players try to knock their opponents off the fighting arena to gather points. In Tails' Fly and Get, players fly around and try to collect more rings than their opponents. Knuckles' Mine Hunt is a single-player game based on the computer game Minesweeper. In Amy's Treasure Island, players move around and search for emeralds, and in Shadow's Speed Demon (which is relatively similar to the stage ""Radical Highway"" on Sonic Adventure 2), the players race against each other.

Sonic Pinball Party,Yes (SPM),2003,Sonic Team,Sega / THQ,"NA, PAL, JP","The story is set in Casinopolis (in Station Square), where Doctor Eggman turns the people gambling into robots, and brainwashes Miles ""Tails"" Prower and Amy Rose. Sonic must rescue his friends by winning a pinball tournament called the ""Egg Cup Tournament.""
","Sonic Pinball Party is a pinball video game with the objective being to earn as many points as possible. During both the Story and Arcade Modes of the game, the player starts each match with three pinballs, each one shot onto the playfield from the plunger. When the pinball rolls into the hole on the bottom of the table, the player loses a ball and must try again with another. Losing all three pinballs ends the pinball match. The player can control each pinball on the table using the two flippers set on the lower part of the table or the lone flipper placed in the upper right side of the table, and has the ability to shake the pinball table in three directions. With these methods, the player can make the pinball sling and hit one of the pinball tables' targets in order to gain points.
Story Mode features five different matches, while the basic goal of Arcade Mode is simply to gain points until the player has run out of balls. The player's best scores from Arcade mode will be listed in the Rankings if they are high enough. Rings/Blue Chips collected in either Story or Arcade Mode can be used to purchase Chao Eggs and similar objects in the Tiny Chao Garden or as wagers in the Casinopolis minigames.

Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis,,2006,Sonic Team,Sega,,NaN,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling platform game. The gameplay centers on Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops.[2] The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game.[3] The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents.[4] Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground.[5]
At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life.[6] The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint.[7] The game ends when the player runs out of lives,[8] although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if the player has any continues.[7]
Scattered around each level are gold rings.[5] Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life.[5] Rings act as a layer of protection against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, all his rings will scatter.[3] He can recollect some of them again before they disappear. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life.[5] Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling into bottomless pits, or running out of time, kill Sonic regardless of rings or other protection.[2]
The game is split into six principal zones, followed by a short 'Final Zone.' Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles.[9] Each main zone is split into three acts,[2][4] all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a boss fight. For most of the fights, Robotnik's vehicle is fitted with different weapons.[10] After completing the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the single-level ""Final Zone"" for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment.[7] Destroying Robotnik's machine ends the game. A brief animation shows Sonic's return to the first zone, with animals liberated from Dr. Robotnik.
Optionally, if Sonic reaches the end of any zone's Act 1 or Act 2 while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a ""special stage"". In the Special Stages, Sonic is continually curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze. In these levels, the player earns a number of continues for each multiple of 50 rings collected, but the main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald hidden within the maze. Colliding with any of the blocks marked ""GOAL"" ends the level.[4][5]
In an attempt to steal the six Chaos Emeralds and harness their power, the evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik[b] has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island inside aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself.[2] If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. If all the emeralds are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the Chaos Emeralds not collected by the player.[7]

While the player has three lives, the game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.[18][19][5][20] The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing projectiles. The laser cannon is partially protected by stationary defense bunkers which are gradually destroyed from the top by the aliens and, if the player fires when beneath one, the bottom. 
As aliens are defeated, their movement and the game's music both speed up.

Speedball 2,Yes (SPM),2002,Crawfish Interactive,Wanadoo,PAL,"According to the game's story, the first Speedball league (founded in 2095) fails due to violence and corruption. As the organisation gives place to anarchy the game is forced underground, but five years later, in an attempt to regain public interest, Speedball 2 is born. The game starts in 2105 with the emergence of a new team, Brutal Deluxe.
","Speedball 2 makes several changes over the original Speedball. Teams have nine players on court rather than five, and targets on the floor and walls can be hit to receive bonus points. The number of points that a team receives for scoring a goal starts at 10 but can be increased to 15 or 20 via the use of score multipliers located on the walls of the pitch. The same number of points for scoring a goal is given for injuring a player from the opposing team. When a player is injured, he is replaced by one of three substitutes. If all three substitutes are injured, the injured player will be forced to return to the game and play on in spite of his injuries. There are five game modes: knockout, cup, league, practice and multiplayer. Each game lasts for 180 seconds.

It's now up to Spider-Man to figure out what's going on and put a stop to the Goblin's plans before he can take over New York City.
","Peter Parker/Spider-Man is the eponymous protagonist. Spidey's game play is almost identical to that of its predecessor, whereby he has to go around and save any civilians that are in trouble, engage in combat with thugs and (in the Nintendo DS version) take part in 3 touch screen mini-games: The stroke game, the web draw and the arm/disarm games.
Noman Osborn/Green Goblin is the main antagonist and a playable character. Green Goblin's game play is slightly different. Unlike Venom who could be controlled via the touch screen, the Goblin is controlled with the d-pad and face buttons only. His game play involves destroying objects and fighting security guards & S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The Goblin does not take part in any touch screen mini-games.
Exclusive to the DS version, both Spider-Man & Goblin have access to 4 special moves which appear on the bottom screen, landing hits on opponents increases a special meter that, once full, will allow them to use one of the 4 moves available.
The player will also have to keep an eye out for the Threat Assessment Meter (or TAM for short); when it appears, it will point towards where Spidey & Goblin have to go next and also tell the player how much time left they have to solve the problem. If they fail to sort out the problem when the TAM meter runs out, it'll be game over.

After a news report however, Peter changes to Spider-Man and tries to investigate a few criminal activities all taking place in one night, which pits him against a rogue's gallery of villains, including Rhino, Hammerhead, Big Wheel, and Electro. They are led by the game's titular antagonist: the Master of Illusion, Mysterio. After subduing his fellow super-villains, Spider-Man defeats Mysterio himself in the final level.

The game allows players to freely web swing, attack with different punches and kicks, and to shoot web at foes to capture or attack them whilst progressing through levels and avoiding obstacles such as razors and fire. The player can collect upgrades to enhance Spider-Man's strength, health and webbing, as well as ""suits"" that enhance and protect him from certain obstacles.

Spider-Man: The Movie,No,2002,Digital Eclipse,Activision,"NA, PAL","Outcast teen genius Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically altered spider created by Oscorp. He learns how to use his newfound powers in the form of an optional tutorial, narrated by Bruce Campbell. Peter then decides to use his powers for personal gain and competes in a wrestling match as ""Spider-Man""; however, he is cheated out of his prize money by the fight promoter. The promoter is then robbed by a thief, whom Peter lets go out of spite. Shortly after, Peter is devastated when his Uncle Ben is killed by a man, whom the police identify as the leader of the Skulls gang. Peter tracks down and defeats the murderer at a warehouse where he is hiding from the police, only to learn he is the same thief he let go earlier, who then dies after accidentally slipping out of a window. Remembering Ben's words that ""with great power comes great responsibility"", Peter vows to use his powers to fight evil, and becomes the superhero Spider-Man. He also gets a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer after selling photos of himself as Spider-Man.
Meanwhile, Oscorp CEO Norman Osborn and his scientists are investigating the appearance of this new hero. Anxious to develop his Human Performance Enhancer ""Super Soldier"" serum, the main goals of which are already exhibited by Spider-Man, Osborn sends robots to capture him, but Spider-Man destroys them. Later, Spider-Man witnesses the Shocker and the Vulture robbing a jewelry store and escape separately. Going after Shocker first, Spider-Man pursues him through the sewers and into a subway station, where he defeats him. Not wanting to let the Vulture get away with his share of the loot, Shocker informs Spider-Man of his hideout in an old clock tower. Spider-Man climbs the tower, but the Vulture attempts to escape. After a chase through the city, Spider-Man finally defeats Vulture on top of the Chrysler Building, and leaves him and the stolen loot for the police.
Later, Oscorp creates several spider-shaped robots to track down Spider-Man, but they pursue Scorpion instead, whom they had mistaken for the web-slinger due to him also having arachnid DNA. Peter runs into Scorpion after returning to the subway station to take photos of his battle site with Shocker, and, as Spider-Man, helps him fight off the robots pursuing him. However, an increasingly paranoid Scorpion then attacks Spider-Man, believing he is trying to take him back to the scientists who tortured and gave him his powers. Scorpion is defeated, but manages to escape.
Meanwhile, Osborn is fired from Oscorp due to failing to complete the super soldier serum in time, and decides to test it on himself, leading to the creation of a psychopathic alternate personality: the Green Goblin. Sporting an experimental armor, glider, and arsenal of weapons, he attacks the yearly Oscorp Unity Day Festival to exact revenge on those who fired him. Spider-Man rescues his crush, Mary Jane Watson, from being collateral damage, who kisses him, and defeats the Goblin. He offers Spider-Man a chance to join him, but when the hero refuses, the Goblin reveals that he has planted bombs downtown, and escapes while Spider-Man goes to disarm them.
In the Xbox version only, Osborn later hires Kraven the Hunter to capture Spider-Man. Luring him to a zoo, Kraven poisons with a lethal gas and forces him to make his way past corridors filled with traps, all the while he is hunting him. Ultimately, Spider-Man defeats Kraven and leaves him for the police, obtaining an antidote in the process.
After studying a piece of the Green Goblin's gear that fell during their fight and learning it was manufactured by Oscorp, Spider-Man decides to investigate the company's connection with the Goblin. Infiltrating the Oscorp building, he avoids detection by the security as he makes his way to the secret labs, where he discovers chemical weapons, which he neutralizes. After a fight with a giant robot, Spider-Man arrives in Osborn's office and learns that the Goblin knows about Mary Jane kissing him and most likely kidnapped her to lure Spider-Man to him. Following a narrow escape from Oscorp, Spider-Man chases the Goblin to the Queensboro Bridge, where he rescues Mary Jane and defeats the villain. The Goblin then unmasks himself as Norman and, in a final attempt on Spider-Man's life, accidentally gets impaled by his glider. Afterwards, Spider-Man and Mary Jane share a kiss, preventing him from revealing his secret identity to her. Spider-Man then ends the game by saying ""Looks like you're done now. Go outside and play."", breaking the fourth wall.
","Like the 2000 Spider-Man video game, along with Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro, Spider-Man is a level based beat 'em up video game, where the player takes on the role of the superhero Spider-Man. While most levels are indoors, there are several levels set outside, among the sky-scrapers of New York and require the player to web-sling from building to building, as falling below a certain height will result in an instant Game Over. Levels use a scoring system that covers more aspects, such as  ""Time"" (clear level in a set time), ""Perfect"" (not take damage/not be detected) and ""Style"" (use as many combos as possible). Some levels have other specific aspects, such as ""Secrets"" (uncover a secret area), ""Combat"" (defeat all enemies), and ""stealth"" (remain undetected by enemies). Players can gain, depending on difficulty, points on completing these tasks. On easy mode, each bonus is 500 points, normal is 700, and hero is 1000 each.
The basic abilities are swinging, zipping, punching and kicking, dodging, web, camera lock, and the Web Mode in Enhanced Mode. Depending on how the player combines different buttons, it will have different results. Wall-crawling is automatic, and players are also able to lift up heavy and light objects such as cars and chairs. There are 21 different combos, which are unlocked by collecting Gold Spiders, with 4 web controls, each having a type of ""upgrade"" to each. The game also features stealth segments, where Spider-Man can hide in the shadows and remain undetected from the enemy. While the game is primarily in third-person, a cheat code allows players to switch to first-person view.
Completing the story mode on each difficulty unlocks different bonuses, namely alternate skins for Spider-Man: completing it on at least easy unlocks Peter Parker in his civilian outfit and Spider-Man's wrestler costume; on at least normal, Alex Ross' prototype design for the movie Spider-Man costume (which will also cause the Green Goblin to have Ross' early design during battles); and on at least hard, the Green Goblin. Unlike the others, the Goblin plays entirely different from Spider-Man, replacing his web-based abilities with gadgets, such as his signature glider, pumpkin bombs, and razor bats. If playing as the Goblin in story mode, while the levels remain unchanged, the narrative is different, and follows Harry Osborn as he becomes the Goblin after his father's death and investigates a secret plot involving Oscorp, while facing off against another Goblin, who claims to have been hired by Norman Osborn.
More playable characters can be unlocked through cheat codes, such as the Shocker and Captain George Stacy, though they serve only as alternate skins for Spider-Man and play similarly. Mary Jane Watson was initially planned to be unlockable through a code as well, but was dropped due to the perceived lesbianism implications of scenes featuring the player (playing as Mary Jane) kissing with the in-game Mary Jane.

Spider-Man 2,No,2004,Digital Eclipse,Activision,"NA, PAL","Two years after the Green Goblin's death, Spider-Man is struggling to balance his double life, frequently being late or absent for school and leisure time with his friends: his crush, Mary Jane Watson, and best friend Harry Osborn, who blames Spider-Man for his father's death. While stopping a museum robbery, Spider-Man encounters cat burglar Black Cat. The two become allies and work together on multiple occasions to fight crime.
Spider-Man defeats the supervillain Rhino, and is challenged by special effects artists Quentin Beck to partake in a series of ""games"" meant to prove he is a fraud. After Spider-Man prevails, an embarrassed Beck assumes the identity of ""Mysterio"" and leads attacks on both an opera and the Statue of Liberty, which Spider-Man foils. He later tracks down Mysterio to his apartment and overcomes another series of challenges, learning that Mysterio is a fraud, despite his escape.
Harry introduces Peter to Dr. Otto Octavius, a nuclear scientist who is trying to make a fusion power experiment, sponsored by Oscorp, which would provide an unlimited source power to Manhattan. Octavius befriends and begins to mentor Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical â killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter, as Spider-Man, shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process. Later, the arms' AI begins to influence Octavius, who becomes the villain Doctor Octopus after a confrontation with his former friend and colleague, Curt Connors, and aims to recreate the experiment. To get the necessary funding, he robs a bank while Peter is there with his Aunt May, and kidnaps the latter as a distraction, but Spider-Man saves her.
Spider-Man learns that Mary Jane is getting married to John Jameson and reunites with Black Cat, who tries to convince him to give up on his civilian life to be Spider-Man full-time. The pair work together to track down the Shocker, who escaped from prison during Beck's initial competition with Spider-Man, and defeat him, but he escapes. Later, Spider-Man unmasks Mysterio and takes photos of him for the Daily Bugle, only for his boss, J. Jonah Jameson, to make it look like he and Spider-Man were partners. Enraged by this, Spider-Man decides to confront him, but is stopped by Black Cat, who informs him of Shocker's return. Following Shocker's defeat and capture, Spider-Man tells Black Cat that he cannot give up on his civilian or superhero life, which she understands, before parting ways.
Requiring the isotope tritium to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it, who agrees to help in exchange for Spider-Man, and tells him to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with the hero. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Spider-Man confronts Octavius and battles him on top of a New York City Subway train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Spider-Man to save the passengers, which he does at a great physical toll. Spider-Man falls unconscious, allowing Octavius to deliver him to Harry. As Octavius leaves with the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as bigger things are at stake. As Peter arrives at Octavius's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly, Octavius discovers him, and they battle while the nuclear reaction swells. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and helps Octavius return to his senses. Realizing the error of his ways, he gives his life to destroy the experiment, while Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane, who is now aware of his secret identity.
On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment. She confesses her feelings for him and says that she will be fully supportive of his double life. As they hear police sirens in the distance, Mary Jane encourages Peter to go help as Spider-Man.[5]

Octavius befriends and begins to mentor Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical â killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter, as Spider-Man, shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process. Shortly after, the arms' AI begins to influence Octavius, who becomes the villain Doctor Octopus and aims to recreate the experiment.
Spider-Man follows a mysterious van to prison, where a riot broke out. He defeats some of the escaped inmates, before Rhino makes his escape, but is caught in a laser cage set up by the police. Spider-Man fights Rhino, who rams into a gas station, getting knocked unconscious by the explosion. Peter accompanies Aunt May at the bank, when Octavius and his goons rob it, in order to fund a second experiment. Spider-Man beats the goons and saves several hostages, before fighting Octavius inside the vault, but he manages to escape with the money, whilst his remaining goons attempt to make off with May, whom Spider-Man rescues.
The next day, Peter is walking through the city with his friend and crush, Mary Jane Watson, when they spot the latter's car being stolen. After telling Mary Jane to wait while he calls the police, Peter, as Spider-Man, follows the carjacker to a warehouse, where he is confronted by the villain Puma. Spider-Man defeats his goons and engages Puma in a battle across the city, culminating at a construction site, where the villain reveals that he was merely a distraction for Spider-Man, which allowed Octavius to kidnap Mary Jane. He is subdued by Spider-Man after trying to escape. Octavius and his henchmen attack Oscorp to steal a piece of equipment. While Spider-Man rescues several hostages and disarms the bombs Octavius has planted throughout the building, he fails to prevent him from escaping with the device, as he is attacked by Rhino, whom Octavius retrieved after his last battle with Spider-Man. He subdues Rhino by freezing him using liquid nitrogen, but as he leaves the Oscorp building, he witnesses the city being torn out of the ground and into the sky.
Discovering that the villain Mysterio is responsible, he pursues and defeats him. Mysterio reveals that he was a distraction for Spider-Man and that Octavius is at the subway station, before restoring the city to normal and vanishing, implying that everything was merely an illusion. Spider-Man arrives at the subway station and battles Octavius on top of a New York City Subway train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Spider-Man to save the passengers whilst he escapes. Later, Spider-Man finds Octavius's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly, but Octavius discovers him, and they battle. As the nuclear reaction swells, Spider-Man defeats Octavius, and helps him return to his senses. Realizing the error of his ways, he gives his life to destroy the experiment, while Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane.
After explaining how he came to be Spider-Man, Peter reveals that he is struggling with his double life, frequently being late or absent for school and leisure time with his friends: his crush Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn, who blames Spider-Man for the death of his father Norman Osborn. While patrolling the city, Spider-Man spots several thugs attempting to rob a bank and stops them. He follows a van chased by the police to the Queensboro Bridge, where the chase has led to a massive traffic accident. After saving the endangered civilians and cops, he continues his pursuit of the van to a warehouse, where the explosives the thugs were carrying provoke a massive fire. Spider-Man puts out the flames and defeats all the crooks.
Harry introduces Peter to Dr. Otto Octavius, a nuclear scientist who is trying to make a fusion power experiment, sponsored by Oscorp, which would provide an unlimited source power to Manhattan. Octavius befriends and begins to mentor Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical â killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter, as Spider-Man, shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process. Later, the arms' AI begins to influence Octavius, who becomes the villain Doctor Octopus and aims to recreate the experiment.
Peter learns that a prison riot allowed several supervillains to escape, and is tasked by his boss, J. Jonah Jameson, with taking photos of the gala at the Wax Museum. There, he discovers that  Mysterio, one of the escaped villains, is holding everyone in attendance hostage, and infiltrates the museum as Spider-Man to rescue them and defeat Mysterio. The next day, Peter accompanies Aunt May at the bank, when Octavius and his goons rob it, in order to fund a second experiment. Spider-Man beats the goons and saves several hostages, before fighting Octavius inside the vault, who escapes with the money. After a chase through the city, Spider-Man loses Octavius.
Spider-Man foils a bomb threat orchestrated by the Vulture, another escaped villain, who reveals that the Shocker also escaped and is planning a job at a warehouse. Spider-Man goes there and defeats both Shocker and Rhino, the one who broke the other villains out of prison. As he leaves them for the police, Shocker reveals that they were hired by Octavius to steal a piece of high tech equipment, and Spider-Man deduces that he is trying to recreate the experiment.
Requiring the isotope tritium to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it, who agrees to help in exchange for Spider-Man, and tells him to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with the hero. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Spider-Man confronts Octavius and battles him on top of a New York City Subway train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Spider-Man to save the passengers, which he does at a great physical toll. Spider-Man falls unconscious, allowing Octavius to deliver him to Harry. As Octavius leaves with the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as bigger things are at stake. As Peter arrives at Octavius's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly, Octavius discovers him, and they battle. Asthe nuclear reaction swells, Peter defeats Octavius, reveals his identity, and helps Octavius return to his senses. Realizing the error of his ways, he gives his life to destroy the experiment, while Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane, who is now aware of his secret identity.
On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons her fiancÃ© at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment. She confesses her feelings for him and says that she will be fully supportive of his double life. As they hear police sirens in the distance, Mary Jane encourages Peter to go help as Spider-Man.
","The console version of Spider-Man 2 is a third-person action-adventure video game, set in an open world based on New York City and composed of Manhattan, Roosevelt Island, Ellis Island, and Liberty Island. Players take on the role of Spider-Man and complete missionsâlinear scenarios with set objectivesâto progress through the story.
The story is divided into multiple chapters, each with its own set of objectives, such as purchasing upgrades for Spider-Man, or acquiring a certain number of hero points from completing side missions. These side missions are given by random pedestrians across the game's map, and mainly consist of battling criminals, stopping speeding cars by jumping on top of them and punching them, taking injured people to the hospital, or saving construction workers from falling to their deaths. Each chapter includes at least one story mission related to the main plot.
Players are able to web swing, crawl walls, and fight enemies using a variety of combos. They can use Spider-Man's ""spider sense"" to slow down time and dodge incoming attacks, including gun fire. This version of the game was considered innovative at that time due to its physics-based algorithms that simulate Spider-Man's web swinging in three dimensions, creating a new game mechanic unlike the traditional jumping or flying of previous Spider-Man games. Combat is far more complex, as it involves carefully timing the player's attacks and dodges. After the completion of the storyline, a warehouse is unlocked, where the player can fight waves of enemies and bosses from the main storyline, as well as an additional one: Calypso.
The PC version of Spider-Man 2 is a level-based beat 'em up. The player can use several combos and web-based attacks to fight enemies, as well as a power move that causes Spider-Man's fists to glow and deal extra damage; it is charged up by defeating enemies. In addition to wall crawling, web swinging is also featured in the levels set outdoors, though the player can only attach webs to glowing orbs that float in the sky.
The PlayStation Portable version of Spider-Man 2 is similar to the game's predecessor, reusing locations from that game. A level-based beat 'em up, it uses a scoring system that covers more aspects, such as the time taken to complete a level or the number of combos used. The player can crawl walls and web swing, though Spider-Man is only able to move forward in a straight line. They can also lock their camera onto certain enemies and web them. The stealth segments from the first game have been removed.

Spider-Man 3,No,2007,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL","A year after Doctor Octopus' death, Spider-Man stops a new gang, the H-Bombers, from blowing up the Carlyle building. The next day, Peter Parker explains that the city finally sees Spider-Man as a hero and there has been no major threat recently, though new problems arise in the form of Eddie Brock, Peter's rival at the Daily Bugle, Harry Osborn, who blames Spider-Man for his father's death, and new gangs terrorizing the city: the H-Bombers, the Apocalypse, the Arsenic Candies, and the Dragon Tail. However, these gangs don't prove to be too much of a threat, as Spider-Man easily foils their plans on multiple occasions. At the same time, an alien symbiote inside a meteor crashes in Central Park and attaches itself to Peter's shoe, who was there with his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry becomes the New Goblin to exact revenge on Peter.
Later, Peter investigates the lab of his science teacher, Dr. Curt Connors, who was reported missing, and discovers he was experimenting on himself with a lizard DNA serum in the hopes of regrowing his right arm, only to transform into the ferocious Lizard. After the Lizard attacks him, Spider-Man pursues him into the sewers, discovering that numerous other people have also been transformed into lizard, and the villain's plot to release these lizards into the city. While Spider-Man defeats the Lizard and thwarts his schemes, he escapes further into the sewers. Upon returning to the city, Peter is attack by the New Goblin, whom he defeats and knocks unconscious before taking him to the hospital to recover. Elsewhere, escaped convict Flint Marko accidentally falls into a cockpit full of sand while scientists are doing experiments there, and is transformed into the supervillain Sandman.
The next day, Spider-Man continues his battle against the H-Bombers, aided by Detective Jean DeWolfe, whom he helps investigate some crooked cops. Upon learning the Bomber's leader is businessman Luke Carlyle, Spider-Man foils their final attack on the Daily Bugle, saving J. Jonah Jameson and destroying the Bomber's helicopter in the process, despite Carlyle's escape. At the same time, Spider-Man investigates the connection between Scorpion and science corporation MechaBioCon and learns that head scientist Dr. Stillwell has placed Scorpion under mind control and transformed him into a living weapon to carry out various tasks. Spider-Man ultimately frees Scorpion from Stillwell's control, with the help of Dr. Andrews, who developed feelings for Scorpion and wants his wellbeing. Upon returning home, Spider-Man is approached by the symbiote, which envelops his body, leading to a new black suit that enhances his powers. After spotting Sandman robbing a bank, Spider-Man pursues him into the subway and fights him, before the symbiote's influence leads him to almost kill Sandman by releasing a large amount of water upon him.
The following day, Peter humiliates Eddie Brock as Spider-Man and earns a promotion in his place after they both receive the same assignment, leading him to swear revenge against both Peter and Spider-Man. He also finds the Lizard again and reverts him back to his human form, despite Kraven the Hunter and Calypso attempting to hunt the Lizard and then transforming him into ""Mega Lizard"". After Spider-Man again foils the schemes of the gangs he has been facing, the Kingpin attempts to unite them against Spider-Man, who foils his plan after a fight which results in Kingpin's apparent death. Later, after Peter becomes violent during a date with Mary Jane, she breaks up with him. Realizing the black suit is increasing his aggressiveness, Spider-Man retreats to a nearby church and removes the symbiote using the bell's sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote then attaches to Brock, who followed Spider-Man and watched him unmask himself, turning him into Venom.
Spider-Man later helps Connors make up for his actions by curing the other lizards, and helps Scorpion exact revenge on Stillwell, defeating Rhino and rescuing Dr. Andrews in the process. When Scorpion attempts to kill Stillwell, Andrews helps him realize this will only make him the monster Stillwell wants him to be, so he leaves, while Spider-Man hands Stillwell over to the police. Meanwhile, Venom blackmails Sandman into helping him kill Spider-Man, threatening to murder his daughter. The pair kidnap Mary Jane to lure out Spider-Man, while a recovered Harry comes to his friends' aid. He rescues Mary Jane and defeats Sandman, before Venom kills him. Spider-Man ultimately defeats Venom using sonic vibrations, but the villain dies after getting impaled on some steel bars.
Afterwards, Spider-Man reconciles with Mary Jane, while Sandman is reunited with his daughter, who was rescued by the police. He apologizes to Spider-Man and leaves peacefully. The game ends with Peter resuming his neverending battle against crime, while stating that the only way to honor and remember those he loves is by never giving up being Spider-Man.[2][3]
A year after Doctor Octopus' death, Spider-Man stops a new gang, the H-Bombers, from blowing up the Carlyle building. The next day, Peter Parker explains that the city finally sees Spider-Man as a hero and there has been no major threat recently, though new problems arise in the form of Eddie Brock, Peter's rival at the Daily Bugle, Harry Osborn, who blames Spider-Man for his father's death, and new gangs terrorizing the city. However, these gangs don't prove to be too much of a threat, and Spider-Man makes quick work of the H-Bombers, foiling their attacks on the Daily Bugle's Printing Plant and Regional Office. At the same time, one of his assignments from his boss, J. Jonah Jameson, have him encounter a group of humanoid lizards in Central Park.
That night, while Peter is with his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson, an alien symbiote inside a meteor crashes nearby and attaches itself to Peter's shoe. Shortly after, Peter is attacked by Harry, who became the New Goblin to exact revenge on him, but defeats him and knocks him unconscious, before bringing him to a hospital to recover. Elsewhere, escaped convict Flint Marko accidentally falls into a cockpit full of sand while scientists are doing experiments there, and is transformed into the supervillain Sandman. After returning home, Spider-Man is approached by the symbiote, which envelops his body, leading to a new black suit that enhances his powers. The following day, after the H-Bombers attack the Daily Bugle, Spider-Man defeats them for good and unmasks their leader as businessman Luke Carlyle.
Later, Peter investigates the lab of his science teacher, Dr. Curt Connors, who was reported missing, and discovers he was experimenting on himself with a lizard DNA serum in the hopes of regrowing his right arm, only to transform into the ferocious Lizard. After the Lizard attacks him, Spider-Man pursues him into the sewers, discovering that numerous other people have also been transformed into lizard, and the villain's plot to release these lizards into the city. He also encounters Kraven the Hunter, who is trying to hunt both him and the Lizard. While Spider-Man defeats the Lizard and thwarts his schemes, he escapes further into the sewers. Eventually, Spider-Man tracks down the Lizard again, just as he was beaten by Kraven and reverted to his human form. While Spider-Man defeats Kraven, Connors injects himself with another serum that transforms him into ""Mega Lizard"", but Spider-Man is able to again restore him to his human form. Grateful, Connors later promises to help Spider-Man analyze the symbiote.
After another assignment from Jameson leads Spider-Man to encounter a vampire, he defeats the creature and brings it to Connors, who reveals the vampire to be renowned biochemist Dr. Michael Morbius. With Morbius claiming that his wife Shriek was responsible for his transformation, Spider-Man track her down, thwarting her attempt to mind control the people of New York, though Shriek escapes. After battling Shriek's gang, the Waste Tribe, Spider-Man learns about her whereabouts and takes Morbius to her so that she could cure him. However, Shriek turns Morbius against Spider-Man, who defeats him, before fighting Shriek as well. Using the symbiote to overcome her powers, Spider-Man defeats Shriek, who then cures Morbius of his vampirism, but is left severely weakened and falls into a coma. Spider-Man leaves the unconscious Shriek in Morbius' and Connors' care and departs.
Peter later humiliates Eddie Brock as Spider-Man and earns a promotion in his place after they both receive the same assignment, leading him to swear revenge against both Peter and Spider-Man. He also battles Sandman after he robs an armored van, but symbiote's influence leads him to almost kill Sandman by releasing a large amount of water upon him. After Peter becomes violent during a date with Mary Jane, she breaks up with him. Saddened, he realizes the black suit is a negative influence on his behavior and retreats to a nearby church, where he removes the symbiote using the bell's sonic vibrations. However, the symbiote then attaches to Brock, who followed Spider-Man and watched him unmask himself, turning him into Venom. He blackmails Sandman into helping him kill Spider-Man, threatening to murder his daughter. The pair kidnap Mary Jane to lure out Spider-Man, while a recovered Harry comes to his friends' aid. He rescues Mary Jane and Sandman's daughter, and helps Spider-Man defeat Sandman, before Venom kills him. Spider-Man ultimately defeats Venom using sonic vibrations, causing Eddie to black out after the symbiote collapses and disintegrates.
Afterwards, Spider-Man reconciles with Mary Jane, while Sandman is reunited with his daughter. He apologizes to Spider-Man and leaves peacefully. The game ends with Spider-Man resuming his neverending battle against crime, while stating that the only way to honor and remember those he loves is by never giving up being Spider-Man.
While patrolling the city, Spider-Man spots a building on fire, so he goes there and defuses a bomb. He then spots the New Goblin flying around and realizes that he is his friend, Harry Osborn, who believes Spider-Man murdered his father and wants retribution. After Spider-Man defeats Harry, he leaves to rescue morecivilians trapped in a building.
Later, Spider-Man encounters Sandman, but is unable to defeat him, so he returns home, where the alien symbiote envolps him, leading to a new black suit that enhances his powers. The following day, Spider-Man thwarts the schemes of the villains Electro, who has kidnapped a senator, and The Mad Bomber, who has planted explosives throughout the city. After defeating both villains, Spider-Man encounters Sandman again and pursues him,  eventually defeating him by violently washing him away down the sewers.
Realizing that the symbiote's influence is starting to corrupt his mind, Spider-Man removes it using sonic vibrations from the bell of a nearby church. However, the symbiote attaches to Eddie Brock instead, who desires revenge against both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, turning him into Venom. Spider-Man is later attacked by both Venom and Sandman, who survived their last fight and now has quicksand powers at his usage. After defeating Sandman, Spider-Man and Venom engage in a final battle, until Venom falls off the building and seemingly dies. Spider-Man proceeds to call for an ambulance, as the symbiote leaves Eddie's body slithers away into the night. The game ends on a cliffhanger with a screenshot reading ""The End?""
","Similarly to its predecessor, Spider-Man 3 is a third person action-adventure video game, set in an open world based on Manhattan. Players take on the role of Spider-Man and complete missionsâlinear scenarios with set objectivesâto progress through the story. Missions are structured in a non-linear manner like in the Grand Theft Auto series, meaning that the game features multiple storylines which can be played in any order the player desires. Once the player has completed a number of missions from each storyline, they unlock a main story missions, related to the plot of the film. In addition to the story missions, the game also features side missions, such as races, combat tours and disarming bombs, as well as random attacks in the streets by the city's gangs, which the player can choose to stop. If a number of gang attacks in a specific district are thwarted, then the gang loses control of that district and attacks will no longer occur there. This crime wave mechanic is also influenced by the story missions and combat tours involving each gang.
Players can web swing, crawl walls, and fight enemies using a variety of combos. The game introduces quick-time events and collectibles, which are scattered throughout the city, including the subaway (which is now accessible while free roaming). It also features the symbiote black suit, which is automatically unlocked after a number of story missions and introduces a ""rage"" mechanic, that is charged up by attacking enemies and allows the player to deal extra damage. Unlike in other versions of the game, once unlocked, the black suit in unremovable, and the player returns to Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume only near the end of the story.
The game also features an upgrade system where upgrades are unlocked automatically as the player progresses in the story. In the Collectors Edition of the PlayStation 3 version, the New Goblin is a playable character, similarly to the Green Goblin in the first game (the New Goblin is also briefly playable in the final mission of the game across all three version). The New Goblin is also available as downloadable content for both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. He can be selected from the game's menu, much like the player can select from regular Spider-Man and black suited Spider-Man once they completed the story with the former. If choosing to play as black suited Spider-Man, then the game starts from the beginning, but all upgrades are unlocked, therefore this essentially serves as a New Game Plus. If choosing to play as the New Goblin, then none of the story missions are available, but the player can still free roam through the game's map and complete side missions. On PC, the New Goblin is playable only through mods. Peter Parker in his civilan outfit is also playable on PC through mods, and through a glitch that prevents progression in certain story missions across all three versions.
This version of the game is similar to the Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 one. The narrative is mostly unchanged, save for a few slightly modified missions and several secondary storylines being replaced with a new one featuring Morbius and Shriek, as is the map, featuring only a few esthetic changes due to these consoles' limitations. New CGI cutscenes are included, in addition to several recycled from the next-gen version. The most notable change is the ability to change between the red and blue costume and the black suit at any time through a short quick time event (once the latter is unlocked). The black suit actually requires to be removed from time to time, because, if worn for too long, it will corrupt Spider-Man, leading to a game over.[1] There is a cooldown before the black suit can be worn again.
The game features an upgrade system where upgrades need to be manually purchased; there are no upgrades for the black suit. Upgrades are purchased through hero points, similarly to Spider-Man 2, which are unlocked from completing either the main story missions or side missions, including races and combat tours, as well as some that appear randomly across the map. Unlike previous Spider-Man games, these random missions are activated through a radio transmission, allowing the player to accept or decline them, and may vary from stopping muggins to delivering fruit pies. The collectibles and crime wave mechanic from the next-gen version also return, albeit with several modifications. Collectibles, mainly the Spider Emblems, which can be found only during story missions, actually reward the player once found, by unlocking the black suit. The crime wave is now influenced mainly by the combat tours, as there are no longer main story missions involving the gangs. Rather than clearing the city of the gang's influence, the player's goal is to help the NYPD take over, which is depicted as its own ""gang"", allied to the player, in the menu map.
The primary features for the Wii version are motion controls. By flicking the Wii Remote & Nunchuck, the player can perform various actions such as combat, and one of Spider-Man's trademark abilities, web swinging. There are also certain mini-games tailored to the motion controls. This can range from disarming a bomb, to completing quick time events. The PlayStation Portable version is a full-on port of the PlayStation 2 version with an extra feature exclusive to the version known as ""Conquest Mode"": an extra mode where the player has to traverse the city and complete challenges such as combat tours, delivering items, and protecting civilians under a time limit. The more challenges are completed, the more hero points the player earns. Once time has elapsed, the score is calculated and the most recent save is loaded; the mission can be replayed any time to get a higher score. Conquest Mode can be exited with a visit to the Daily Bugle building in order to return to the main game. Conquest Mode can be accessed via the title screen or Scrapbook.
The Game Boy Advance version is a level based 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up; only the characters are rendered in 2.5D. It follows the film's plot, with very few additions. A map is used to enter levels, and each level has question bubbles that give hints. The Nintendo DS version is completely 2.5D and uses the Touch Screen to execute most attacks. Players can put on the black suit at will, but it will be disabled if Spider-Man's health is too low. This version supports wireless multiplayer.

Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron â Search For Homeland,,2002,Hyperspace Cowgirls,THQ,"NA, PAL","In the 19th-century American West, a young Kiger Mustang colt, Spirit, is born to a herd of wild horses. Spirit soon grows into a stallion and assumes the role of leader of the herd, whose duty is to keep the herd safe. Spirit is a courageous leader but has great curiosity. One night, upon spotting a strange light near his herd, the stallion decides to investigate the location, where he finds restrained, docile horses and their human wranglers sleeping around a campfire. They wake up and, seeing him as a magnificent specimen, chase and capture him, taking him to a US cavalry post.
At this time, the US army is fighting the Indian Wars and taking over the soon-to-be western United States. Frightened and confused, Spirit finds himself enslaved among other horses. Then, he encounters ""The Colonel"", who decides to have the mustang tamed, refusing to believe the idea of Spirit being too stubborn, but Spirit manages to fight off all attempts to tame him. To weaken Spirit, the Colonel orders him tied to a post for three days with no food or water. Meanwhile, a Lakota Native American named Little Creek is also brought into the fort and held captive. Spirit is later supposedly broken in by the Colonel, who speaks his idea of how any wild horse can be tamed. However, Spirit gets a second wind and finally throws him off. Frustrated, the Colonel attempts to shoot him before Little Creek (who frees himself from his bounds with a knife) saves Spirit from being shot as they, along with the rest of the horses, escape from the post. Little Creek's mare, Rain, meets them along with other natives who capture Spirit again.
After returning to the Lakota village, Little Creek tries to tame Spirit with kindness, but Spirit refuses to be ridden. Little Creek ties Spirit and Rain together, hoping she will teach him a thing or two. When Spirit tries to leave, she insists on staying, then shows him her world. Spirit begins to warm up to Little Creek and falls in love with Rain. At the end of their time together, Little Creek tries again to ride him, but Spirit is still unwilling. He then decides that Spirit will never be tamed and frees him. As Spirit asks Rain to come with him to his herd, a cavalry regiment led by the Colonel attacks the village and Rain runs off to find Little Creek. During the vicious battle, the Colonel tries to shoot Little Creek, but Spirit runs into the Colonel and his horse, deflecting the shot and saving Little Creek's life. However, Rain is shot by the Colonel, knocking her into the river. Spirit dives into the river to try to rescue Rain but is unsuccessful and they both plummet over a waterfall. Spirit finds Rain dying from her injuries and stays by her side until the army captures him. Watching Spirit being pulled away, Little Creek arrives, vowing to free him to satisfy his life-debt and follows the men after tending to Rain.
Spirit is loaded onto a train and taken to a work site on the Transcontinental Railroad, where he is put to work pulling a steam locomotive. Realizing that the track will infringe on his homeland, Spirit breaks free from the sledge and breaks the chains holding the other horses. They escape, and the locomotive falls off its wooden sledge and rolls down the hill, chasing Spirit back to the work site. The locomotive demolishes two wooden storage sheds and then slams into another locomotive, causing a massive explosion that sets the forest ablaze. Spirit attempts to escape the fire, but is trapped when the chain around his neck snags on a fallen tree. Little Creek appears in time and saves Spirit, and together they jump into a river to escape the flames.
The next morning, the Colonel and his men find Spirit and Little Creek. Spirit allows Little Creek to ride him and a chase ensues through the Grand Canyon. Eventually, they are trapped by a gorge. Little Creek gives up, but Spirit manages to successfully leap across the canyon. Spirit's move amazes the Colonel; he humbly accepts defeat, stops his men from shooting the two, and allows Spirit and Little Creek to leave. Spirit returns to the rebuilt Lakota village with Little Creek and finds Rain nursed back to health. Little Creek decides to name Spirit the ""Spirit-Who-Could-Not-Be-Broken"" and sets him and Rain free. After saying goodbye to Little Creek, the two horses return to Spirit's homeland and eventually find Spirit's herd, where he joyfully reunites with his mother.
The eagle from the beginning (that had been seen at various points throughout the story) reappears and flies upwards into horse-shaped clouds.

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom,No,2003,NickGames,THQ,"NA, PAL","The game revolves around the theme of robots invading Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob's hometown. Plankton, the evil genius owner of the Chum Bucket, has built a new machine called the Duplicatotron 3000 to produce an army of robots to use to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula. After creating them, he realizes that the switch on the Duplicatotron has accidentally been set to ""Don't Obey"" and the robots quickly kick him out of the Chum Bucket before taking it over and then wreaking havoc all over Bikini Bottom.
Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with toy robots and horses. SpongeBob and Patrick are bored with the toys and wishes he could play with real robots. Patrick uses his ""magic wishing shell"", believing it will make their wish come true the following morning. SpongeBob wakes to find that his house has been trashed by real robots. He receives a fax from Mr. Krabs, stating that he would give SpongeBob a Golden Spatula for every certain amount of Shiny Objects he collects for him. Shiny Objects must be collected to open or activate various tolls throughout the game. Outside, SpongeBob finds a disappointed Plankton, who lies and claims that the robots appeared suddenly and kicked him out. Plankton convinces Spongebob to help him back into the Chum Bucket by embarking on a perilous quest to find golden spatulas and get rid of the robots, secretly intending to regain control of them once back inside.
Every area in the game has a unique set of missions to collect Golden Spatulas including a main overarching mission. SpongeBob travels to Jellyfish Fields, where he finds that Squidward has been stung by jellyfish and travels to defeat King Jellyfish in a battle and obtains some of his jelly for Squidward's stings.

Later, SpongeBob and Sandy save Squidward from Robot Patrick.
SpongeBob then falls asleep, allowing him to enter his friends' dream worlds to search for more golden spatulas. After Plankton, SpongeBob and his friends finally gain access to the Chum Bucket, they discover the gigantic Robot SpongeBob and learn that Plankton was responsible for making the robots. Plankton sets the switch on the Duplicatotron to ""Obey"" (by placing an Obey sign over the don't obey setting), only to find out Robot Plankton has been controlling the robots instead. Robot Plankton tells SpongeBob he has interfered in his plans for the last time and tells him âSpongeBob, meet SpongeBotâ. SpongeBob attempts to disable Robot SpongeBob's brain from the inside while fending off frequent attacks from Robot Plankton. Upon succeeding, SpongeBob hopes that Plankton learned his ""lesson"". The Duplicatotron produces several more Robot Planktons, which begin arguing among themselves. The game ends after SpongeBob says that their work is not done, as there are still many robots running amok in the city.
The game then cuts to The Spongeball Arena, where the player rolls around in ball form in a large arena, while the credits roll on the screen. If the player collects all 100 golden spatulas, the game ends with a special surprise cutscene of all the game's characters singing the theme song.
In the Windows game, SpongeBob and Patrick have a robot tea party with toy robots and SpongeBob wishes upon ""the first falling clam"" that robots ""were people too"". The next day, Bikini Bottom gets attacked by an army of robots. Patrick, Sandy, Gary, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs are captured by robots and locked inside cages. SpongeBob works his way through Bikini Bottom, the Flying Dutchman's Graveyard, the Kelp Forest, the Chum Bucket, and the Mermalair to locate his friends and various objects stolen by the robots.  After all locations' games are played, a video is unlocked for the end of the game where SpongeBob and Patrick discover that Plankton was the one behind the robot invasion. Plankton admits that it was his fault and that the robots are not listening to him and the only way to control the robots is to set the switch to ""obey"" mode. Instead, Patrick fools around with the machine, accidentally pulling its obey switch off, which turns off the machine and deprograms the robots. After SpongeBob and Patrick leave, Plankton tries to tell them that he will be back with another plan.
The Game Boy Advance version is a 2D platform game with four chapters, each containing seven levels, all of which have their own unique puzzles. In the game, Mr. Krabs thinks the robot invasion is putting him out of business, so his assignment for SpongeBob is to fight the robots to get into the Chum Bucket to shut down Plankton's Duplicatron.
","The core gameplay involves collecting items and defeating the robots which have attacked various areas in Bikini Bottom, while crossing platforms and avoiding environmental hazards like spikes and flames. Some areas require different characters to beat, as each character has their own unique abilities. The player can control SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy. Switching characters in console versions require the player to find a Bus Stop, upon using which the current character will switch to another, and using it again will switch back to the previous character, giving the player an option of two characters in each level. The default character throughout the game is SpongeBob; Sandy and Patrick do not share any levels as playable characters.
The game is a 3D platform game, requiring players to collect three main types of items. 'Shiny Objects' are the game's currency and can be used to pay tolls within game areas or to buy golden spatulas from Mr. Krabs.[2] 'Golden Spatulas' are used to grant access to new areas, being hidden throughout the game and can also be earned by completing tasks set by Squidward Tentacles and several other characters from the cartoon. Patrick's 'Socks' are also spread throughout the game and he will reward SpongeBob with a Golden Spatula in exchange for 10 of his socks. SpongeBob can also blow bubbles to form different shapes as special attacks/moves which can be used to advance further in the game, and can learn two new bubble moves from Bubble Buddy as the game progresses.[3]
Props are also included in the game. Trampolines help the player bounce to further ledges or platforms, buttons activate certain things throughout the game, and pressure pads are like buttons; however, the effects of it are only active while the player stands on the pressure pad, or there is another object placed on top. Once whatever is holding down the pressure pad is removed, the effects of it are undone. There are also character specific abilities, such as Sandy being able to swing from Texas hooks, SpongeBob being able to dive downward on a bungee hook, and Patrick's ability to pick up and throw melons called ""Throw Fruits"" and ice cubes called ""Freeze Fruits"". Though some areas can be navigated by any character, several sections can only be completed with a specific character, due to each one having unique abilities. SpongeBob can create a bubble helmet for head-butting enemies. Patrick can throw objects at buttons, robots, and pressure pads, and can throw ""Freeze Fruits"" into bodies of Goo to freeze them. Finally, Sandy can glide over large gaps and destroy enemies and objects with her lasso.
The Windows version features a series of mini-games and greatly differs from the console versions.[4] In the game, SpongeBob's friends have been captured, and to free them, the player must play multiple games while collecting objects, including a game show-style trivia game where he must score 500 points to free the character from the cage. The player then takes control of the freed character in a game where the character locates more objects and battles the robots. Once all items are collected (money, magic shop items, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's gadgets, SpongeBob's dressing clothes, and various pieces of a machine), SpongeBob must return the items to their rightful owners.
Gameplay for the GBA version is much different as well, as it is a 2D platform game. Rather than being non-linear, like the home console versions, the GBA version is level-based, although still visiting most of the locations from the home console versions. Combat is much more limited, done through blowing bubbles onto enemies to turn robots off or back on; robots cannot be permanently destroyed, as replacements will appear through a portal in their starting positions, so enemies are used to solve platforming challenges. SpongeBob can ride a seahorse named ""Mystery"" in certain levels. Like other GBA games of its era, it uses a password system rather than saves.[5]

SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab,Yes,2006,WayForward,THQ,"NA, PAL","The game takes place inside the dreams of SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star and Sheldon J. Plankton, where each individual most survive the most bizarre adventures.
In SpongeBob's dream, his bed transforms into a hot rod and he drives it around a track across Bikini Bottom, which now resembles an automobile-hot rod paradise inspired by the works of Ed Roth. After upgrading his car and winning several races against dream versions of Patrick, Plankton, and Gary, he accidentally drives into an unnoticed pit. SpongeBob falls through the pit until he reaches the bottom, where he is eaten by an Alaskan Bull Worm. He encounters Old Man Jenkins, who is building a biplane to escape the bowels of the worm. Within the worm, SpongeBob locates spare parts from the chief of a village of castaways and an eccentric inventor for the biplane, while also getting rid of a huge can of chili that's causing the worm stomach problems.
Patrick's dream is a masked superhero called ""Starfishman"" in a cel-shaded comic book-like world where everyone resembles him. Starfishman pursues the villainous ""Dreaded Patrick"", who attempts to remake the town in his own image. Starfishman goes around town beating his paper-flat minions, getting clothes for a man after saving him from a train, and giving the mayor laundry detergent to help ""clean up the town."" Starfishman eventually beats Dreaded Patrick in a showdown at his secret lair. However, he fails to see a surprise attack, is knocked out, and gets tied to a rocket originally intended for another starfish, which launches into outer space. The rocket hits an asteroid, a piece of which falls to Earth and traps Dreaded Patrick. In outer space, Starfishman manages to untie himself from the rocket after flying around. He shoots asteroids threatening a space station and continues to fly around until he meets up with a U.F.O. in the shape of a patty. He shoots off its wings, destroying it. Then Patrick returns to Earth while trying to figure out how to stop the rocket.
In Plankton's dream, he zaps a crumb of a Krabby Patty with his Enlargatron Ray to learn the secret formula. However, the ray's coordinates are inaccurate, causing the Krabby Patty to overgrow and mutate into a vicious monster. Plankton decides to fight back with size but the inaccurate ray only makes him the height of an average citizen, which was not enough to dwarf the patty. Plankton, carrying only his freeze ray for protection, is pursued by the patty throughout Bikini Bottom. Plankton eventually loses the patty by hiding, but then gloats about his victory, allowing the patty to find and crush him. Plankton then awakes to find the giant Krabby Patty sleeping beside him. As he sneaks away, Karen's wake-up call awakens the patty. Plankton sets the accurate coordinates for his ray and transforms himself into a giant, atomic-powered mutant plankton. The patty flees and Plankton gives chase, destroying Bikini Bottom in his wake. He finds the patty hiding in a skyscraper twice and destroys each floor to force it out. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Jenkins fly out of the worm's mouth and find Plankton. The giant patty escapes Plankton's clutches and clings onto SpongeBob's plane, with an enraged Plankton in pursuit.
SpongeBob tries to avoid Plankton while devising a plan to defeat him. After a long pursuit through the city, including the sewers and a construction site, SpongeBob engages Plankton on a radio tower. SpongeBob destroys the support bolts to make the tower unstable, causing Plankton to fall on his rear. As Plankton aches in pain, SpongeBob feels sorry for him and decides to help him up, which allows Plankton to grab the plane. Just then, Starfishman lands his rocket and teams up with Mermaid Man and the Bikini Bottom Defense Force to battle Plankton and rescue SpongeBob. He defeats a small army of plankton minions to reach an experimental shrink ray, which he uses to undo Plankton's transformation and save his friend. After Plankton is shrunk, he accompanies Patrick and SpongeBob into a dream bubble, where they meet a doctor with a Krabby Patty for a head.
The doctor explains that the reason for their bizarre dreams is because they all ate a Krabby Patty before falling asleep; the chemical composition of the patties affected their biorhythms and caused a reaction that resulted in the dreams. SpongeBob then asks the doctor how he knows so much about Krabby Patties; the doctor strips his outfit off to reveal that he is the Krabby Patty in their own dreams. In order to wake up, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton decide to chase after him and head into the final level where they race against one another for the Krabby Patty trophy in a bizarre, nightmare-like racetrack. The game starts off with SpongeBob as the only choice available. To unlock Patrick and Plankton, the player must collect Sleepy Seeds spread throughout the game.
The level's ending depends on which character the player wins with:
In the ultimate ending, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton wake up in one another's dream and it is revealed that this was all Gary's dream, who was the one who ate the Krabby Patty. After waking up, he goes around town and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton before returning home to rest. SpongeBob then brings back a Krabby Patty for Gary, who refuses to let him eat it because it may give him nightmares. Gary then watches as SpongeBob has a ""conversation"" with the patty. As SpongeBob prepares to eat the patty, he is eaten by the Alaskan Bull Worm, causing Gary to faint into slumber.
","Players have access to three playable characters during the game, SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Starfishman (Patrick Star in superhero form), and Sheldon J. Plankton, and must guide them through nine levels of play in a dreamworld.[3] Four different types of gameplay have been incorporated into the game, known as flying, rampaging, racing, and platforming. During flying sections, the game sets obstacles, one in front of another, and the player must maneuver past them. In most cases, the game will tell the player which way to fly (up, down, left, and right). On the Wii, the player uses the controller like an actual plane control stick. The most common cases of this is when SpongeBob uses his plane to attack a giant-sized Plankton.[4] In rampage levels, the player controls a giant sized Plankton and uses special powers and moves to destroy everything in their path.[5] The player's laser power is indicated by a bar on the right side of the screen, which refills after use. The Wii version features controller movements that respectively activate moves. Racing gameplay is similar to most racing games; it is featured in both the air and the ground's gameplay, fuel must be collected in order to keep the player's vehicle running.[6] The platforming gameplay is spread throughout the game, such as when Plankton must escape from a live Krabby Patty or when Patrick Starfishman saves Bikini Bottom from his evil form, Dreaded Patrick.[7]

"SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants!",,2005,NickGames,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"In the home console versions of the game, the city of Bikini Bottom is producing an anniversary show of The New Adventures of Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy, executive produced by Gill Hammerstein (voiced by Nolan North), in which the titular SpongeBob SquarePants wishes to play as the starring role.[2] SpongeBob must compete with the other characters in the series â namely Patrick Star, Squidward Tentacles, Eugene H. Krabs, Sandy Cheeks, and Sheldon J. Plankton â in order to impress the talent scouts and land the lead role of the villain.[3]
The game includes 30 unique minigames (referred to as ""auditions"") that have different play style and objectives, though the common goal is to get the highest points. Each minigame is based on an area or location in Bikini Bottom. Every location has three minigames within it. There are a total of 8 locations for a total of 24 minigames that are played through story mode. The other six are unlockable bonus minigames. Examples of the minigames include a driving test, whose goal is to finish the first through three driving courses; a jailbreak, whose goal is to free as many prison inmates as possible without getting caught; and a rhythm minigame, whose goal is to match the short and long musical notes that travel toward a marker. There are two types of minigames: the free-for-all type, where all players compete against each other, and the 2-vs-2 type, where players are divided into two teams of two.
The game features six playable characters: SpongeBob, Squidward, Sandy, Plankton, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs. Before the game starts, the player has to choose one of the six characters, then choose whether to have up to three other players join or add AI-controlled opponents. All characters are available from the start and have only aesthetical differences in minigames, e.g. SpongeBob is marked yellow; they have no gameplay advantage over each other. However, the player has the option to choose gameplay difficulty in three different options (Easy, Med, Hard), and also set the AI opponents' difficulty in three options (Silly, Norm, Smart).
In Story Mode, the players are required to obtain a certain amount of popularity points to move through the 8 locations in the game. If no characters achieve enough points, the minigames will have to be replayed until one of them passes the mark. If two or more characters achieve the same amount of points, a tiebreaker game will be played to determine the winner, depending on how many of them are tied. Additionally, each location also ranks the number of points all four characters obtain; having the highest means that that particular character becomes the main star of the location's film segment. Once all 8 locations are passed, the movie clips are combined to form a full-length cinematic.
There are three phases of Story Mode: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The movies produced are the same; the difference lies in the number of points required to pass a location. Each phase also has its own action figures and artworks unlocked by fulfilling a certain objective and attaining a certain score, respectively, in a specific minigame. The game will warn the player when attempting to proceed to the next phase, since there is no way to go back to an earlier phase other than starting over from the Bronze phase; once the player choose to enter a new phase, all figures and artworks from the previously completed phase not yet collected will remain locked.
The game also includes Tournament mode, in which four players can compete in a tournament of up to five minigames. Also included is Single Audition, in which four players can compete in a single minigame. Any minigame that has been unlocked can be played in either mode. All three Story Mode phases also apply to Tournament and Single Audition, giving the players a chance to obtain figures and artwork they missed out on in Story Mode.
Once a Story Mode phase is completed, a full 30-minute-long film is available to view.
The film is the result of the wins in the audition games. In the episode of The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, they get arrested by a police officer for being accused of stealing the Sand Stadium. In prison, they meet their foes, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble, but find themselves teaming up with their arch rivals to save Bikini Bottom from their biggest foe yet; the Sneaky Hermit - whose goal is to take over Bikini Bottom by stealing every building and putting them on his back. Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble think the idea is crazy and only agree to help the heroes because the Hermit also stole their lairs. Eventually, the Hermit has taken every building in Bikini Bottom except for the Sea Needle, which is locked in place by a literal key lock. Mermaid Man cluelessly informs the Hermit that he can use window-washing platforms to get up and unlock the building. The heroes chase the Hermit with the window-washing platforms to stop him. Having gotten advice from a hunter in Jellyfish Fields, Barnacle Boy suggests to Mermaid Man to stop the Hermit by making him sneeze, thus dropping all of the buildings back into place. Mermaid Man uses pepper he got from the Krusty Krab to do so and the Hermit is defeated. At the end of the movie, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble choose to remain evil and run off to continue doing dirty deeds against the citizens, while Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive off to the Sand Stadium in their Invisible Boatmobile, ending the segment.
The PC version of the game is a point-and-click adventure, with the main objective being to find actors for the TV show.
In the Game Boy Advance version, Gil Hammerstein and his crew are going to film a special episode of The New Adventures of Mermaidman & Barnacleboy, but the two heroes are missing, so SpongeBob and his friends volunteer to find them. They are also offered roles for the special episode. The Game Boy Advance version is split into four worlds â Mermalair, S.S. Rest Home, Goo Lagoon, and Sound Stage. Each world contains four levels, consisting of platforming levels, driving levels, and mini-games. By completing levels, some extra mini-games can be unlocked and in one level per world, the character who reaches the end of the level earns a role. After completing the four worlds, the Final Game is unlocked, allowing the player to play the events of the TV show through mini-games.
The main collectibles in the game are Golden Stars, which are used as in-game currency. The Golden Stars can be used to buy extra lives or mini-games.
The Game Boy Advance version features four playable characters: SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, and Squidward Tentacles. While a character must be chosen before playing a level, the player can change characters any time in the game. Each character has their own set of abilities.

SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman,,2002,NickGames,THQ,"NA, PAL","One day, SpongeBob wakes up and begins playing fetch with Gary, leading the snail to dig up a treasure chest. SpongeBob opens the chest and finds a bottle, which, upon rubbing it, releases doubloons all over Bikini Bottom and releases The Flying Dutchman. The Flying Dutchman tells SpongeBob that he will take Gary to work on his ship for all eternity for digging him up; after briefly leaving to check on his ship, he makes good on this promise.
SpongeBob proceeds to travel across seven different locations to recover letter tiles; there are nine in each, which spell out his name, and each set leads to a treasure. These treasures, as explained by one of Squidward's books on ""How to Defeat Evil Spirits"", are personal possessions from when the Dutchman was alive, which can apparently weaken him; according to the book, collecting all seven will make SpongeBob immune to the Dutchman's hypnotizing spell, allowing him to put up a fight to save Bikini Bottom.
To collect the tiles, SpongeBob must complete a wide assortment of challenges and missions for other characters, such as delivering food for Mr. Krabs in Downtown Bikini Bottom, fixing Patrick's TV antenna, helping Sandy rid her tree dome of bees and wasps after giving her a beehive (that he mistakes for an acorn) as a gift, bringing Patrick food, winning a jellyfishing contest, beating all the games at Plankton's new amusement park ""Chum World"", assisting Sandy with cleaning up garbage, curing Patrick's stomachache, chasing down Plankton, and defeating Larry the Lobster in a karate match.
As SpongeBob continues in his quest and becomes increasingly impervious to the Dutchman's power, the Dutchman kidnaps his other friends (apparently extremely satisfied with Gary's hard work unlike to his old crew) and terrorizes Bikini Bottom. This culminates with attempting to murder SpongeBob by dropping heavy crates and barrels into his house, forcing him to flee. He winds up in the Dutchman's graveyard, where he assists the Dutchman's disgruntled pirates get their fair share of ""booty"" (i.e. doubloons) in exchange for the use of their cannons and collects the seventh and final treasure.
Believing himself to now be immune to the Dutchman, SpongeBob boards the Dutchman's ship and rescues his friends, but is confronted by the Dutchman. His cockiness is crushed by the omniscient narrator, who informs him that Squidward's book was out-of-date and that the new edition explains he is mostly immune to the Dutchman's magic, but not completely. He proceeds to fight the Dutchman anyway, and his victory is cemented by sucking the Dutchman back into his bottle. Afterward, as the Dutchman's ship catches fire, SpongeBob escapes with his friends on a flying boat to celebrate at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob SquarePants is giving Gary a walk through Jellyfish Fields, Gary then smells Kelp Nip and runs off. After SpongeBob finds Gary, he finds a chest, opens it and finds a bottle. SpongeBob then opens the bottle and the Flying Dutchman appears. After SpongeBob mistakes the Dutchman for a genie that will grant him a wish, he tells SpongeBob to find his ten treasures and doubloons that got scattered around Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob does so, but the Dutchman ultimately abducts Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward. After SpongeBob finds all of his friends on the Dutchman's ship, he battles the Dutchman himself. After the Dutchman is defeated, the player is given a list of wishes to choose from, each one depicting a screenshot of said wish. One of them involves giving SpongeBob his own TV show, when that one is chosen, a screenshot of the show's original logo appears.
","The home console versions consist of 3D platform gameplay. Playing as SpongeBob, the player gains several abilities throughout the game that are needed to progress. The player can alternate between abilities by entering tents set up in each level. Throughout each level, the player must locate and collect letter tiles. After each level is completed, the player must solve a jigsaw puzzle that forms a picture of where to locate the next treasure, each time that happens Spongebob has a diving rod that would let him know if he (and the player) is close.
The Game Boy Advance version is a side-scrolling platform game with five worlds: SpongeBob's Home, Jellyfish Fields, Sandy's Treedome, the Krusty Krab, Doubloon Bonus World, and a final world on The Flying Dutchman's ship. All levels have SpongeBob looking for the ten treasures (which are unlocked with three keys) and doubloons. Upon completing the game, the player can replay all the levels to go back for what they missed.

SpongeBob SquarePants: SuperSponge,No,2001,NickGames,THQ,,"It is Patrick's birthday, and SpongeBob wants to give him ""the best present ever"": a photo signed by his favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. However, the heroes want nothing more than to get rid of SpongeBob, so they keep sending him to accomplish random tasks around Bikini Bottom. After returning from one such task, SpongeBob discovers that the television in Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's retirement home is broken, so he searches Bikini Bottom for repair tools. After finding the tools, SpongeBob returns to fix the television. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, feeling grateful, finally give SpongeBob the autographs. The game ends with Patrick thanking SpongeBob for the autographs, and everyone wishing him a happy birthday.
","The game is divided in five worlds (listed as ""chapters""): Bikini Bottom, The Center of the Earth (an underwater volcano), Prehistoric Bikini Bottom, Rock Bottom, and Industrial (the industrial district of Bikini Bottom). Each world is divided into four levels, which are cleared by collecting the object desired by Barnacle Boy. In addition, the fourth level of every chapter has a boss enemy who must be defeated to progress.
Scattered through all the levels there are spatulas. By collecting all 100 in a level, SpongeBob earns an extra life. In the PlayStation version, spatulas serve as Sonic the Hedgehog-style health measures for the player. If SpongeBob is touched by an enemy, he loses all the collected spatulas, and if he is touched by an enemy without any spatulas, he loses a life. In the Playstation version, there is a continue feature that features Patrick at SpongeBob's house all alone, he encourages the player to keep going on SpongeBob's quest by saying where are his friends, and thinking they forgot his birthday. In the Game Boy Advance version, a separate health measure is used, which can be replenished by collecting items like Salty Fries, Salty Shakes, and Krabby Patties. Lives also can be obtained by finding underpants.
In the PlayStation version, by collecting a certain number of spatulas in every chapter, a secret level named ""Six Clams Adventure Land"" (a reference to the Six Flags amusement park) can be unlocked. In those levels, set in an amusement park, SpongeBob must ride through obstacles and collect all 25 flower tokens. These tokens can be used to buy props for Patrick's birthday party at the end of the game.
"
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,No,2004,WayForward Technologies,THQ,"NA, PAL","The plot of the video game is based on the film, albeit liberties are taken occasionally. King Neptune's crown has been stolen by Plankton and SpongeBob and Patrick must retrieve it from Shell City and save Bikini Bottom.
The gameplay is similar to that from Heavy Iron Studios' previous game, Battle for Bikini Bottom, as it was created using the same engine and shares many assets. There are 18 levels in the game that loosely follow the storyline of the film. The player controls SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, both of whom have their own unique set of abilities. Each level contains a main objective and side tasks. Four levels involve a boss enemy that the player must defeat to progress to the next level. Boss enemies include the giant frogfish from the film, Dennis (who is fought twice), and King Neptune. Each main level and side task will give the player a Goofy Goober Token once completed, and the player needs these tokens to learn certain skills and proceed to the game. Although the player only needs to complete a level's main component in order to unlock the next level, it is not possible to complete the game only doing the main levels (though the player does not need to do all of the side tasks).
There is also an upgrade system in the game. As the player collects ""Manliness Points"" (represented by glowing weights), they will learn new moves for SpongeBob and Patrick which are needed to complete the game. Once the player collects enough manliness points, they get an ""Upgrade Point"" which can improve a skill's effect (or be used to increase the player's Max Health from three to up to six units). Although very helpful in progressing and completing the game, upgrades are not mandatory to doing so.
The game does not use a life system; if the player dies, they are reverted to their last checkpoint, the game does not count deaths.
Each completion of a challenge or its side task grants the player a Goofy Goober Token. In order to learn the moves required to advance in levels and the stories, SpongeBob and Patrick will have to complete these side missions (like the extra driving and minigame challenges) to get these tokens. SpongeBob and Patrick have a few moves, and when they get a sufficient number of points, they can upgrade a move or increase their max health. Their health units are measured in Krabby Patties; they each contain only three, but can be upgraded up to six over time. The moves will improve in effectiveness when upgraded.
Throughout the game are cutscenes that are either in-game animations or FMV sequences that resemble slideshows and feature stills from the movie.
The gameplay has features that are reminiscent of point-and-click adventure games, similar to that in SpongeBob SquarePants: Employee of the Month and the PC version of SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants!. It mainly follows around SpongeBob and Patrick in a various number of locations. The game consists of 8 chapters that loosely follow the plot of the film, with additional story details being described in cutscenes between chapters that feature narration over still pictures.
The GBA game is a 2D platformer split between 6 worlds to progress through, plus many bonus levels, and a boss at the end of each world. Unlike the console versions, there is a life system, and there is no save feature; instead, players are given a variety of level passwords as they progress through the game. Like the PC version, the story is told through still pictures, but this time with on-screen text.

SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis,,2007,Altron,THQ,,"Patchy the Pirate is stuck in traffic on US 101 near Encino and gets cross that he is going to miss the new SpongeBob episode, and his super rare eight track also breaks down.  His cell phone rings, and Potty tells him to hurry because the episode is about to start.  Patchy tells Potty to record the episode, but Potty tells him that he threw the Betamax machine in the garbage, making him more mad.  The traffic lines moves, but suddenly, he finds himself nowhere, and finds out that ""Encino is gone"", and then he cries that this is not the only time a Lost-City had occurred. He tells us that the episode is what we should watch instead of watching him suffer. Later, Patchy gets his eight track fixed, but not for long when it explodes again and produces smoke.
Later on, Patchy gets hallucinations and he finds a man dressed in a tall SpongeBob outfit (who is actually Tom Kenny, Patchy the Pirate's actor and the voice of SpongeBob himself), who tells him that he is SpongeBob SquarePants in real-life form. The SpongeBob then tells him that he will be back in Encino if he ""believes"". Then, Potty wakes him up after he thought he is back in Encino, which is all just a dream. Patchy begins to eat a sandwich, which Potty brings to him, but he finds mayonnaise on it. He tries to give it to a vulture.
After the end of the SpongeBob special, Patchy finds Encino shrunk to a very small size, and then, he finds three aliens, which explain that their son, Norbluck 5, was playing with his Shrink-A-Tron again. Patchy yells at them that he wants his town back in full size, and he keeps saying, ""There's no place like home"" (obviously parodying the scene from The Wizard of Oz). Sympathetic by Patchy's misery that he wants to go home because he missed the entire story, Norbluck 5's mother gets the Shrink-A-Tron given from her son, and she presses the big red button control, making a tornado disaster to fix it up. Then, Patchy is glad to be back in Encino, but soon, a giant Potty the Parrot crushes him into the house (presumably showing that Norbluck 5 had once again used his Shrink-A-Tron to make Potty huge).
SpongeBob and Patrick find a piece of a medallion to the lost city of Atlantis, but have no idea what it is. They take it to the Bikini Bottom Museum to see if the staff there know what it is. SpongeBob and Patrick run into Squidward, who thinks they stole the missing half of the medallion. He soon matches it to the displayed other half of the amulet and tells them it was the key to Atlantis. After hearing the story of Atlantis, the only thing SpongeBob and Patrick want to see is the ""World's Oldest Bubble."" Squidward then proceeds to reconnect the two-halves of the amulet, opening the ""path to Atlantis"", which is a bus that runs on ""song fuel"". When the characters run out of ""song fuel"", the bus then crash-lands into the city of Atlantis. The group is unknowingly followed by Plankton, who plans to use Atlantean weapons to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula.
Inside Atlantis, they meet the Atlantean Emperor, Lord Royal Highness, who shows them a grand tour of the fortress. During the tour, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and Squidward each get distracted by places in Atlantis; Mr. Krabs (unsurprisingly) by the treasury room, Sandy by the science laboratory, and Squidward by the art gallery. Meanwhile, Plankton checks out the armory vault, intent on using the city's lost weapons (the Atlanteans had abandoned the idea of warfare long ago) for his own ends, and steals a tank. Finally, SpongeBob and Patrick get to see the world's oldest living bubble. Patrick takes a picture of it, which causes the bubble to pop, horrifying the pair.
As Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and Squidward relate their experiences in Atlantis to Lord Royal Highness, SpongeBob and Patrick anxiously return and attempt to conceal the bubble's destruction until Patrick blurts it out. Lord Royal Highness is not enraged at them, and reveals that the one they popped was just a prop for the tourists. He then shows them the real oldest living bubble, which Patrick then takes a picture of, causing it to pop. Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to attack the group, but they manage to escape. Just as they flee outside, Plankton arrives in the stolen tank and fires at them, only to discover to his fury that it shoots ice cream. Lord Royal Highness captures Plankton, and decides that ""a talking speck"" would be a fantastic replacement for the bubble. SpongeBob and friends go home, though all except SpongeBob are sad as they had wanted to stay in Atlantis; Lord Royal Highness bids them farewell, but then orders the medallion pieces to be hidden to prevent ""any more visitors like them"" from arriving.

SpyHunter,No,2002,Midway,Midway,"NA, PAL","The plot deals with Alec Sects, an F-15 pilot who was trained by the FBI, as he tries to take down Nostra, an Israeli-based international company that produces food products, bio-chemicals, genetics, e-commerce and children's software. Daemon Curry, a man who believes himself to be the figure mentioned in several religions (for example: the second christ/antichrist and believes in the prophecies of Nostradamus), is the founder and leader. To deal with him, the IES create a team called Spyhunter. Curry has reason to believe that it is the same person who stopped him in 1983 (Spy Hunter), when he was trying to launch his plan, he sends all he has after him. Curry's plan is to use four EMP weapons mounted on satellites, dubbed the Four Horsemen, to stop all electricity in the world, then plans to rule. Originally Alec does light missions, mostly destruction of Nostra property (like a vehicle created from Nostra and stolen IES technology). However, Nostra hijacks the ""Weapons Van"" and an Interceptor, and Alec is forced to destroy it. Eventually, the G-6155 Interceptor receives an upgrade (and a change of paint) to the G-6155 Interceptor II, complete with an EMP Launcher, Scanner, and a shorter Turbo lag time. Nostra's schemes become more dangerous, and Alec finds himself returning to most of the previous Nostra bases for more intense missions such as destroying weapons of mass destruction. Later, He finds the headquarters where the Four Horsemen are based in Petra. After a hard-fought battle, the Four Horsemen are diffused and explode, while Alec escapes on the Interceptor II. Following a parachute dive from the cliff-side base and landing safely on the ground, he heads toward Russia, setting the stage for SpyHunter 2. Curry's fate is never shown, but he is most likely killed in the explosion as he is not mentioned among the Nostra ringleaders in the sequel.

Spy Hunter / Super Sprint,Yes,2005,DSI Games,DSI Games,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Spy Hunter is a vertical scrolling driving game with the player in the role of a spy driving an armed sportscar. The object of the game is to travel the freeway destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible while protecting civilian vehicles. The game uses a top-down perspective.
The game begins with the player driving the fictitious G-6155 Interceptor. Various enemy vehicles try to destroy the player's car or to force it off the road, including a helicopter that drops bombs from overhead. A counter increments the score while the car is moving and on the road. Additional points are earned destroying enemy vehicles using weapons or by forcing them off the road. After an initial lead-in time during which the player has an unlimited supply of cars, the player must earn extra cars by obtaining sufficient points. Destroying non-enemy cars halts the score counter for a short while, and no points are scored whenever the player's car is off the road. The car can be destroyed by a hard collision with another vehicle, if it is hit by an enemy weapon (including the craters blasted into the road by the helicopter's bombs), or by running far enough off the roadway (or waterway).
Following periodic forks in the road, players can enter new regions with different terrain or weather conditions. Players can also augment the car's standard machine guns with other weapons by entering the weapons van, which appears in each new territory and can be periodically summoned by pressing the blinking ""Weapons Van"" button. Three special weapons are available: oil slicks, smoke screens, and surface-to-air missiles. Each has limited ammo and are lost if the player's car is destroyed. The game's dashboard shows which weapons are available, when lit.
It is possible for the player to convert the car into a go-fast boat for brief periods by driving through a special boathouse which appears infrequently at the side of the road after which the player is attacked by two different enemy boats.
The in-game road is endless and the game itself has no ending.[2]

Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over,,2003,Digital Eclipse,Disney Interactive Studios,"NA, PAL","Juni Cortez, after the events of the second film has retired from the OSS. He now lives a quiet life and works as a private detective, although his salary is very little. One day, he is contacted by President Devlin, former head of OSS, who informs him that his sister, Carmen Cortez, is missing after a mission gone wrong.
Arriving at the technological and computer part of the OSS, Juni is reunited with a now reformed Donnagon and his wife Francesca, who explain that Carmen was captured by the Toymaker, a former OSS informant. The Toymaker was imprisoned in cyberspace by the OSS, but he has since created Game Over, a virtual reality-based video game which he intends on using to escape cyberspace via players that reach Level 5, which is unwinnable. Juni agrees to venture into the game, save Carmen, and shut down the game, given only twelve hours to win. He is also informed that his sister was last seen on Level 4.
In the game, Juni finds the challenges difficult, having only nine lives within the game and already losing one at the start. While roaming a cartoon-like medieval village, he finds three beta-testers, Francis, Arnold, and Rez, who provide him with a passage to the Moon and launch him into space, but mostly to get rid of the competition.
Juni lands on the Moon, losing another life in the process, and receives an opportunity to bring in a fellow ally to assist him. He chooses his grandfather Valentin, who uses a wheelchair and has a personal history with the Toymaker. Valentin receives a power-up which gives him a robotic bodysuit, allowing him to walk and possess superhuman strength and durability. Distracted by a butterfly, he abandons Juni, telling him that they will regroup later. Searching for the entrance to Level 2, Juni ventures into a robot battle arena where he fights a girl named Demetra in order to return to Earth and Level 2. In the fight, he receives a robotic, more powerful suit, and he is placed on a huge mecha to combat Demetra. In the 3-round fight, in which he loses another life, he defeats Demetra and returns to Earth.
He meets the beta-testers again who believe he is a player named ""The Guy"", who can supposedly beat Level 5. Rez is unconvinced and challenges Juni to a ""Mega-race"" involving a multitude of different vehicles, which will allow them on Level 3. The only apparent rule of this game is ""Win, at all costs"". Juni wins the race with help from Valentin, and Demetra joins the group; she and Juni display romantic feelings for each other, with him giving her a med-pack with extra lives and she provides him with an illegal map of the game. Upon entering level 3, Arnold and Juni are forced to battle each other, the loser getting an immediate game over. During the fight, Juni loses almost all of his lives, but Demetra swaps places with Juni and is defeated, seemingly getting a game over, much to Juni's sadness.
The group arrives at Level 4 where Juni finds Carmen, released by the Toymaker, who leads the group on. Carmen notices their grandfather is with them and tells Juni that the Toymaker is the reason their grandfather uses a wheelchair. Juni follows a map to a lava-filled gorge. The group surfs their way through the lava. The OSS finds out about the history between the Toymaker and Valentin. Fearing that Valentin might seek revenge, Donnagon attempts to prevent them from reaching Level 5, but fails, as they fall into the lava and discover that it is harmless, and they reach a cavern where they find the door to Level 5. Outside the door to Level 5, Carmen informs them that they only have 5 minutes left. After the other gamers start to think that Carmen and Juni are deceivers and Rez threatens to give Juni a game over, the real ""Guy"" appears and opens the door. However, he is struck by lightning as part of a booby trap set by the Toymaker when the door to Level 5 is breached, which makes him lose all of his hundred lives and get a game over, forcing the group to move on without him.
In the Level 5 zone, which is a purple-ish cyberspace, Demetra then appears, claiming to have gotten back into the game via a glitch but Carmen identifies her as ""The Deceiver"", a program used to fool players. Demetra confirms this and apologizes to a stunned Juni before the Toymaker attacks the group with a giant robot. Valentin then appears, holding the entrance back to the real world open so the group can escape. However, he cannot come with them since someone needs to hold the door open. Demetra, shedding a tear, quickly holds the door open so he can go with them. After their return though, it is revealed that Valentin released the Toymaker, with the villain's army of robots now attacking the city.
Juni and Carmen summon their family members: Parents Gregorio and Ingrid, Gregorio's brother Machete, their Grandmother, and Uncle Felix. With too many robots to handle, Juni calls out for everyone to help, summoning characters from the first two films. All of the robots are destroyed except for the Toymaker's. Valentin confronts The Toymaker, and forgives the Toymaker for what he did to him, which Valentin had been trying to find the Toymaker to do for 30 years. The Toymaker shuts down his robot and joins the rest of the Cortez family and their friends in celebrating their families.

Spy Muppets: License to Croak,,2003,Vicarious Visions,TDK Mediactive,,"Kermit the Frog works as Agent Frog (who is based on James Bond) for Agent Patriot (who is based on M) of M.U.P.P.E.T. Agent Patriot debriefs Agent Frog to defeat the three Piggy Galore, Dr. Nose, and King Prawn.
After beating a villain, Agent Frog brings one of the villain's gadgets to agents B and B upon completion.
Piggy Galore (a parody of Pussy Galore) used to be one of M.U.P.P.E.T's best and expensive agents before she went bad. M.U.P.P.E.T has spotted some of Piggy Galore's pig henchmen. After B and B prepare Agent Frog's spy car, Agent Frog heads out with Agent Argh assigned to back-up duty. Agent Frog and Agent Argh follow the pig henchmen to Piggy Galore's hideout in an abandoned warehouse. Agent Frog then has to throw food from the conveyor belt at the pig henchmen to keep them from grabbing him. Agent Frog then confronts Piggy Galore where they end up in a food fight.
If the level is lost, Agent Frog gets locked away and Agent Argh must break down a door to rescue him.
When Miss Piggy is defeated, Agent Frog confiscates the food-flinging device and hands it to B and B while Piggy Galore is locked up at M.U.P.P.E.T.'s jail.
Dr. Nose (a wordplay on Dr. No) has a plan to turn the Earth into a giant egg that was at one point foiled by M.U.P.P.E.T. and is trying it again. Agent Patriot dispatches Agent Frog to stop it, with Agent FFF assigned to back-up duty. Dr. Nose's chicken henchmen are preparing to leave by snowmobile, and Agents B and B say they cannot help, as they are too busy with an unknown project, and Agent Frog must get the snowmobile ready himself. Agent Frog is suspicious, but he doesn't have time to worry about it. He and FFF follow the chickens to Dr. Nose's lair, and Agent Frog must subdue the chickens standing guard outside with snowballs. He enters the lair, and discovers Dr. Nose has his machine set up and is ready to execute his plan, and must break the machine by turning all its lights to red.
If the level is lost, Agent Frog is handed to the Swedish Chef to be cooked into a frog omelet. Agent FFF stumbles upon the control room and must divert the eggs from the frying pan and into the Swedish Chef's face.
When Dr. Nose is defeated, Agent Frog takes the intact part of Dr. Nose's invention and hands it to B and B while Dr. Nose is locked up at M.U.P.P.E.T.'s jail.
Agent Patriot tells Agent Frog that M.U.P.P.E.T. suspects that the organization S.H.E.L.L. (Secret Hidden Evil League of Lobsters) led by King Prawn is mixed up in the plot since they are acting fishy, and says there are some S.H.E.L.L lobsters leaving the headquarters, which Agent Frog must follow to the S.H.E.L.L. headquarters. Frog goes to Agents B and B to get his boat set up for pursuit, but they say they are too busy, and he must do it. Agent Frog follows the lobsters in his boat after setting it up, with Agent Rat of S.E.W.E.R. assigned to back-up duty.

When King Prawn is defeated, Agent Frog takes King Prawn's mechanical claws to B and B (who say they can find a use for it) while King Prawn is locked up at M.U.P.P.E.T.'s jail.
As B and B work on studying the inventions, Agent Patriot states to Agent Frog that they might know who the master villain is. It is revealed that B and B are really Statler and Waldorf in disguise while the real B and B are bound and gagged behind a door. Statler and Waldorf have assembled the enemy gadgets to build a giant robot so they can take over the world because they can't stand watching another minute of this. Now it is up to Agent Frog to defeat them and save the day even after they have ripped Piggy Galore out of her jail cell.

Spyro: Attack of the RhynocsNA|Spyro AdventurePAL,No,2003,Digital Eclipse,VU Games,"NA, PAL","In the Professor's lab, The Professor shows Spyro and Sparx his two new inventions. The first is a projector-like peephole machine, enabling them to spy on Ripto. The Professor then displays his next new invention â Butler, a large mechanical bear designed to help him in his lab. Unfortunately Butler malfunctions and the Professor has failed to equip it with an ""off"" switch. Spyro manages to short Butler out by luring him into a power generator, then the peephole machine malfunctions and the hole in the fabric of space begins to expand rapidly.
A terrified Professor tells Spyro about ""Hearts"" â magical objects with very special properties and the only way to control the problem. The Professor is about to give him a warp device that will allow him to travel to all the other lands, when Ripto appears through the hole and claims the device for himself with the advantage he can rapidly conquer the surrounding lands. Ripto warps out Spyro along with Sparx and Butler to the Dragon Shores.
After Spyro is able to travel back to the Professor's Lab and travel through the peephole's vortex to Ripto's Chateau, he finds Ripto about to lower the Professor into a pit of lava, but engages in combat with Spyro. After being defeated, Ripto captures him and Sparx. Butler reappears, and the Professor orders him to trap Ripto. Ripto, now incapacitated, yields the final heart and the Professor permanently seals the hole in space.
","The game plays similar to the previous two Game Boy Advance entries but expands on roleplaying concepts and item collecting than the previous two and has a much higher focus on role playing than platforming unlike the previous two entries. Players still collect gems and various other collectables and use portals to warp from level to level.

Spyro: Season of Ice|Spyro AdvanceJP,No,2001,Universal Interactive Studios,Universal Interactive Studios / Digital Eclipse Software,"NA, PAL, JP","Spyro and Sparx are on holiday with Bianca and Hunter, when Hunter panics mistaking a balloon for a sheep in a flying saucer. Spyro finds on the balloon a message from Zoe asking for help from Grendor who is kidnapping fairies. Bianca left her spellbook behind in the library while she was looking for holiday pamphlets. Grendor had been browsing in Bianca's library and came across Bianca's spellbook. He tried it out, hoping to become a powerful magician, however, he read it upside down and became a two-headed Rhynoc with 4 headaches. He planned to capture all the fairies and use their wings to make a cure for his problem. Spyro and his friends head off to stop Grendor from carrying out his plans.
After Spyro traverses many levels (including a first confrontation with Grendor) and saves all the fairies besides Zoe herself, he confronts Grendor for a second time and defeats again, rescuing Zoe. Once free, Zoe lightly chastises Grendor for causing trouble, then uses her magic to cure him of his extra head and all his headaches. Grendor apologizes for his actions, and Spyro and his friends return to their vacation.
","The objective of the game is to release fairies from their ice prisons and to progress from realm to realm before defeating Grendor. Spyro starts off in the Autumn Fairy Home one of the four seasonal fairy realms in the game. In each realm, gems can be collected, critters like sheep can be destroyed for healing butterflies (and some to grant extra lives), special objects (like pumpkins) can be ignited, baskets can be broken for more gems and Bianca and Hunter in various spots can give hints. Spyro can never die in the seasonal realms, with the fairy magic force protecting him from drowning in the water and no enemies present. The realms link to several places via portals. To access them, a number of fairies have to be procured, indicated next to the level name.
Some of the portals will go to levels which are similar in gameplay to the realms except they have enemies to destroy, dangerous territory that harms Spyro, water which Spyro can drown in and special encounters. There are always characters to talk with. One or two characters in a level will asks a request to do something in exchange for a fairy (often referring it to something other than a fairy like a diamond gem). In some levels, Spyro can catch thieves, which can be tricky to do. When all enemies are destroyed, a portal appears and will take Spyro back to the seasonal realm he came from.
Some of the portals will go to a long stretching horizon landscape in which Spyro flies across. The game can be played in Normal and Hard modes, but both will have to be played and won to obtain two fairies. The object of these levels is to move around the screen, flying through hoops, destroying lines of enemies and scattered enemies in a set time limit. Destroying enemies with a different colour from the latter and going through hoops grants Spyro extra time. At the end of level, Spyro must face a boss or two and destroy them.
Some of the portals, Spyro cannot go through with Money Bags guarding them, but Money Bags will allow Sparx to enter for a fee. The fee is only paid once. Sparx enters a level with killer bugs and insects. Destroying the nests of those bugs prevents them from spawning. Keys will enable Sparx to access more of the level. Electric panels can be destroyed to disable barriers that protect certain nests. Weapons can be procured to give Sparx limited increased firepower. At the last room of the level, Sparx will have to face and defeat the boss bug to open a portal back to Spyro and save a fairy.
Spyro is required to defeat Grendor twice, the first time to progress after the first two seasonal realms and the second time after the other two seasonal realms to win the game. If the player collects 100% of all the gems and fairies from all levels and realms, a new portal opens to play the extra game ""Dragonfly X"".

Spyro 2: Season of Flame,No,2002,Digital Eclipse,VU Games,"NA, PAL","After the events of Spyro: Season of Ice, Spyro returns to the Dragon Realms and learns an army of Rhynocs infiltrated the Dragon Realms and stole all of its fireflies during Spyro's absence.[2] Without the magic of the fireflies, the dragons cannot breathe fire; their breath, including Spyro's, has been turned icy cold. As a result, the temperatures of the Dragon Realms begin to drop, which threatens to force the dragons to migrate.[3] Spyro, Sparx, Bianca and Hunter set out to uncover the culprit behind the stolen fireflies.[4] Later in the game, a fairy informs the trio that Ripto was the one that stole the fireflies. So the trio set out to stop him. Along the way, They fight Crush and Gulp, Ripto's minions. After crossing more levels they face Ripto in a volcano and defeat him. When he is defeated, the fireflies fly out to warm Up the Dragon Realms.
","The player controls Spyro the Dragon, who must travel through the Dragon Realms and recover the stolen fireflies. Fireflies can be found in many places, either scurrying around in wide-open spaces or hidden behind obstacles. Fireflies can sometimes be received as rewards for performing tasks for the citizens of the Dragon Realms. Once found, the fireflies can be frozen in place by Spyro's ice breath, allowing Spyro to collect them.[5]
In the Dragon Realms, Spyro can access various other levels by walking through Portals. Entering a Portal will transport Spyro to a world where he will meet creatures that are troubled by the invading Rhynocs. When Spyro helps these creatures, a Portal that leads out of that world will appear, allowing Spyro to return to the Dragon Realms. Some Portals can only be accessed after a certain number of fireflies have been rescued.[6]
At the beginning of the game, Spyro has the ability to breathe freezing cold air to freeze enemies and fireflies, charge to penetrate armoured enemies and containers, glide through the air and hover at the end of his flight to gain more hang time. By rescuing a certain number of fireflies, Spyro can regain the ability to breathe fire, and may still use his ice breath thanks to the select button. Spyro can later gain the ability to headbutt and break rock formations and barriers.[7] During the game, Spyro can also use special gates to temporarily increase the range of his fire breath, increase the potency of his ice breath or gain the ability to breathe electricity to recharge electric generators.[8]
The main collectible item is gems, which are scattered everywhere throughout the game. Some gems are hidden in baskets and vases. To obtain these gems, Spyro must use his flame or charge to break open the containers. Gems are used to buy the various services of the character Moneybags.[9]
Sparx, the dragonfly that follows Spyro, acts as Spyro's health meter. Spyro begins the game with four hit points and four lives. Spyro can be harmed four times before he loses a life. Each time Spyro loses a hit point, Sparx changes color accordingly. When Spyro loses three of his four hit points, Sparx disappears.[10] Spyro can restore hit points by feeding Sparx butterflies, which can be obtained by killing small animals such as rabbits and sheep. Occasionally, a special butterfly can be found that can give Spyro an extra life.[11] Sparx can also give advice on how to accomplish particular challenges and hints on how to perform certain tasks. The ability to receive advice from Sparx can be toggled on and off from the pause menu.[9]
During certain parts of the game, the player's control will switch to either Agent 9 the Monkey or Sheila the Kangaroo. Agent 9 is speedier and more agile than Spyro and is equipped with a laser gun with limited ammunition. Special rooms in which Agent 9 can restock on ammunition can be found throughout the levels in which he is controlled. Sheila can jump higher than Spyro and is equipped with a powerful kick to fend off enemies. When all of the gems and fireflies in the game are collected, a minigame in which Sparx is the player character is made accessible.[12]

SSX 3,Yes,2003,Visual Impact,EA Sports BIG,"NA, PAL",NaN,"SSX 3 is a snowboard racing game played from a third person perspective. Players control one of various snowboarders and compete in events set across individual courses in  peaks on a mountain. Unlike previous games in the series, which contain unconnected courses, a freeride mode also allows players to freely roam the open world consisting of all the courses in the game;[8] it is possible for the player to ride from the top of the mountain to the bottom without stopping or reloading each course.[9] New areas are progressively unlocked throughout the game.[10]
Players can gain points by performing tricks,[11] such as grabs, grinds, flips and spins.[12] A feature returning from previous games in the SSX series is the ""adrenaline meter"", which gains ""adrenaline"" when the player executes tricks. It can be used to provide a speed boost or, once it becomes full, perform advanced tricks called ""Ã¼bers""[13] that grant more points than regular tricks. Performing Ã¼bers increases the level of the adrenaline meter, which leads to progressively more advanced ""super Ã¼ber"" tricks and faster adrenaline boosts.[14] Performing multiple tricks of different kinds creates a combo, doubling the points acquired from tricks. However, repeating the same trick causes the number of points it earns to drop.[11] Landing tricks poorly or hitting an object in mid air will cause the snowboarder to ""wipe out"", falling over. The player has the ability to recover their snowboarder more quickly by tapping a button, or alternatively reset the snowboarder back to the course if they get stuck in an area.[15] Both wiping out and resetting result in a loss of adrenaline and the ability to perform Ã¼bers until the adrenaline meter is filled again.[13]
Players complete ""peak goals""âset objectivesâto progress through the single-player mode and unlock all three peaks of the mountain. Peak goals are achieved by completing events, earning money or completing ""big challenges"" and finding collectables, both during freeride mode, which can be accessed outside of events. The player only has to complete one of these goals to progress to the next peak.[8] Completing each peak goal unlocks a trophy for the player.[16]
Each course in the game has a designated event that players can compete in. Events fall under two categories: race and freestyle. Coming first in an event provides the player a gold medal, coming second provides the player a silver medal, and coming third provides the player a bronze medal. It is also possible to obtain a platinum medal by beating certain times or getting a high enough score. The race event objective is to get to the end of the course as quickly as possible. Players race against other snowboarder NPCs on the same course.[16] Races contain multiple routes and shortcuts, which can give the player an advantage over opponents. Players can also use melee combat to knock other snowboarders over, slowing them down and providing the player with adrenaline. Race events have three heats,[8] and the player must come third place or above in each heat to progress. Once all race events are completed on a peak, the player's snowboarder is challenged to a ""backcountry race"" by their rival snowboarder. Winning unlocks a ""peak race"", where the player aims to beat their rival's best time from the peak to the bottom of the mountain. Both races have only one heat. Completing the races unlocks the next peak.[16]
The freestyle events include ""slopestyle"", ""big air"" and ""super pipe"". Their objectives are to get as many points as possible. Slopestyle courses are similar to race courses, as players must ride through a downhill track with multiple paths. However, the goal of slopestyle courses is for the player to gain points by performing tricks. Big air courses are short, with one or two ramps that are designed to allow the player to perform large jumps and multiple tricks in a small amount of time. Super pipe courses contain half-pipes that the player can repeatedly perform tricks on. Freestyle events are structured similarly to race events; each have three heats, and the player is invited to ""backcountry jams"" and ""peak jams"", where points are scored through performing tricks.[8] Completing the freestyle events unlocks the next peak.[16]
Outside of events, players can take part in big challenges.[8] The objectives of the challenges include jumping through hoops and collecting items, among others. Collectable ""crystals"" items can also be found on every course, and can be collected in any event and in freeride. Obtaining enough crystals and completing enough big challenges on a peak unlocks the next peak.[8] In addition to peak goals, SSX 3 contains smaller challenges called ""career highlights"". Similar to big challenges, objectives can vary, and include holding a handplant for five seconds or doing a certain number of Ã¼bers in one event. In freeride, players can travel to any courses they have unlocked and can also go to stations; These areas contain lodges, which allow the player to save their game, edit music playlists, buy attributes to improve their snowboarder, purchase new  Ã¼bers, and buy or equip gear and boards to change the aesthetics of the snowboarder. Money can also be used to buy extras, such as videos, cheat characters and game art.[8] Money can be earned in game by performing tricks, completing big challenges and events, or collecting crystals. Earning enough money on a peak will unlock the next peak.[8] In station areas, the narrator of the game, ""DJ Atomika"", talks to you via ""EA Radio Big"", a fictional radio station. He gives the player information about events and weather, as well as other miscellaneous information. While the player is on a course, the soundtrack of the game is played through EA Radio Big. Depending on how well the player is performing, the music becomes quieter and louder. The player can change what music is allowed to play at lodges.[8]
The PlayStation 2 version of SSX 3 had an online multiplayer mode that allowed two players to race against each other over the internet. The service required an ""EA Account"" to use. Players could join lobbies, where they could challenge players to races, view player statistics such as the global rank of a player, and chat with players using supported USB headsets and keyboards.[17][18] Players could send messages and add up to forty ""buddies"" using ""EA Messenger"", an in-game instant messaging service.[18] The online service has since been discontinued.
Progressive scan (480p) display mode is supported on the Playstation 2 version of SSX 3.  It is activated by pressing the cross and triangle buttons simultaneously on a controller in socket 1; the buttons must be held from the time the Playstation 2 logo appears while starting the game until a screen dialog asks whether progressive scan mode is desired.[original research?]

The important new feature added to the series are the Uber moves. If players are able to fill their boost bar to the maximum, they will be able to perform Uber moves which involve characters taking their feet off their board and doing over the top moves. If a player successfully lands an Uber move, they are given a short amount of time for infinite boost, which can be topped off by performing more Uber moves. Each player can perform five Uber moves, including a personal move if the character is using a board that matches their style. If a player successfully performs six Uber moves, spelling out 'tricky' on the boost bar, they will have infinite boost for the remainder of the level.
Also introduced in the game is a rivalry system in the World Circuit mode. If the player is friendly with another AI character, they will treat the player favourably. However, if the player ends up annoying other AI characters, generally by attacking them during the race in order to fill the adrenaline bar, they will become hostile towards players in future events.

Star Wars: The New Droid Army,,2002,Helixe,THQ,"NA, PAL","In the game, Anakin Skywalker is sent to investigate rumors of the Separatists making a new type of droid, superior to other droids and invulnerable to lightsabers. Anakin travels to Tatooine but is hunted down by Aurra Sing and eventually held in the captivity of Jabba the Hutt. Anakin breaks out and is called to Coruscant. There, Anakin chases and defeats a Dark Jedi named Trenox and uncovers Count Dooku's plot to destroy the Jedi Archives. Anakin stops him, but Dooku escapes. Anakin is next sent to Metalorn, where he is to destroy the Cortosis Droid Factory and capture Wat Tambor, the leader of the Techno Union. Anakin completes both objectives but has to face Count Dooku while leaving the factory. Anakin defeats Dooku and moves on.
The plot is an alternative argument for Revenge of the Sith, where Anakin defeats Dooku and ends up as a Jedi hero, saying the following words to Yoda: ""I Will Always be here to serve the Jedi, Master Yoda, I Give you my word ... ""
","The game is presented in an isometric look, to give the feel of a unique 3-D view. There are numerous droids and aliens to fight, which makes for plenty of opportunities to use Anakin's lightsaber to attack or reflect incoming blaster shots. After passing each successive area, new force powers are earned that can aid Anakin later on. There are five such force powers in all, including the dash, jump, and push skills seen in the movies, as well as two others: the ability to heal faster and the ability to remain invisible for extended periods. Just as stamina decreases when Anakin is attacked, his force power also diminishes after every use. Since there are no health or force items to collect, the only ways to recover stamina and regain force power are to either stand still until both indicators are full again, or use the meditation power learned later in the game to recover faster. NPC's are mainly civilians, though there are some exceptions. Clone Troopers make an appearance (more specifically seven of them, in the underbelly of Coruscant) and fight alongside you to help defeat the droids and mercenaries. They don't move, and they can be killed. The only other instance of an NPC dying in this game is civilian workers on Metalorn falling into vats of molten metal.

Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles,,20012002,Helixe,THQ,"NA, PAL","The game loosely follows the plot of The Phantom Menace and begins as two Jedi are sent to negotiate an agreement between the corrupt Trade Federation and the royal government of Naboo. The meeting turns out to be a trap and the two Jedi manage to fight their way through battle droids on the Trade Federation ship. The pair eventually make it to the planet's surface, where they fight through the swamps that eventually lead to the streets of Naboo's capital city, Theed. In the ensuing battle the Jedi are forced to flee with Naboo's Queen Amidala and several trusted members of her court on her starship.
The group arrives on Tatooine, where they hope to acquire parts to repair the Queen's ship. The environment proves hostile, and the Jedi are forced to defend themselves against Tusken Raiders and an attack by a dark-robed assassin while the parts are acquired. The group eventually makes their way to Coruscant, where a group of criminals instigate an attack. The Jedi fight their way through the attackers to see the queen to the Galactic Senate building. Concerned for the welfare of her planet and finding no hope in the apathetic Senate, the Queen and Jedi return to Naboo to liberate the city of Theed from the control of the Trade Federation.
Now allied with the Gungans of Naboo, the two Jedi fight their way through Gungan ruins to the city. They arrive and liberate a pair of droid STAPs. Utilizing the vehicle's limber controls and fast firing weaponry, they fight their way to the royal palace. Upon arriving the Jedi scale the side of the palace, using their force abilities to jump from platform to platform until they ascend to the top. Arriving, they find their progress blocked by the Sith apprentice Darth Maul, who had previously tried to kill them on Tatooine. The Sith engages the two Jedi as they push through the palace's generator complex. The Jedi gain the upper hand and Maul is defeated. The Jedi celebrate their victory with Boss Nass, leader of the Gungans, and Queen Amidala in a large celebration within the city of Theed.
","Jedi Power Battles is a mix of a platform game and a beat 'em up. Emphasis is placed both on completing jumping sequences and defeating enemies. Players can choose from one of five prequel-era Jedi and run, jump, slash, and use the Force through the game's ten levels, starting on the Trade Federation Battleship and ending with the battle against Darth Maul on Naboo. The player's primary weapon is a lightsaber used to fight through waves of enemies and deflect blaster shots. The lightsaber combat is rather simplified with a system that lets the player lock on to the nearest enemy using the R1 button. Items and the force can also be used for special attacks. On most levels jumping puzzles make up a large portion of the challenge. There are a few segments in which the player can pilot various craft. The single player campaign can also be played in cooperative mode with a second player, while the Dreamcast version has an additional training mode and a two player duel mode. As players progress additional lightsaber combos and force powers are unlocked.[3]
Five primary characters are available for players to use; Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn, Mace Windu, Adi Gallia and Plo Koon, with the latter two being unavailable in the Game Boy Advance version. Characters have specific lightsaber styles, force powers, weaknesses and strengths.[3] The game features both  characters and levels that can be unlocked by completing specific tasks in the game, such as completing the game with a specific character. Up to four additional unlockable characters are available, depending on platform. Queen Amidala of Naboo and Captain Panaka, head of the Queen's security forces, are the only two playable characters to utilize ranged weapons. Sith Apprentice Darth Maul and Jedi Master Ki-Adi Mundi are also unlockable. Four levels can be unlocked which offer players unique minigames.

Star Wars: Episode II â Attack of the Clones,No,2002,David A. Palmer Productions,THQ,"NA, PAL","Ten years after the battle at Naboo,[a] the Galactic Republic is threatened by a Separatist movement organized by former Jedi Master Count Dooku. Senator PadmÃ© Amidala comes to Coruscant to vote on a motion to create an army to assist the Jedi against the threat. Narrowly avoiding an assassination attempt upon her arrival, she is placed under the protection of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker. The pair thwart a second attempt on PadmÃ©'s life and subdue the assassin, Zam Wesell, who is killed by her employer, a bounty hunter, before she can reveal his identity. The Jedi Council instructs Obi-Wan to find the bounty hunter, while Anakin is tasked to protect PadmÃ© and escort her back to Naboo, where the two fall in love in spite of the Jedi Code that forbids attachments.
Obi-Wan's search leads him to the mysterious ocean planet of Kamino, where he discovers an army of clones being produced for the Republic under the name of Sifo Dyas, a deceased Jedi Master, with bounty hunter Jango Fett serving as their genetic template. Obi-Wan meets with Jango, who reveals that the clones were the idea of a man called Tyranus. Obi-Wan deduces Jango to be the bounty hunter he is seeking, and after a brief battle, places a homing beacon on Jango's ship, SlaveÂ I. He then follows Jango and his clone son, Boba, to the planet Geonosis. Meanwhile, Anakin is troubled by visions of his mother, Shmi, in pain and decides to return to his homeworld of Tatooine with PadmÃ© to save her. Watto reveals that he sold Shmi to moisture farmer Cliegg Lars, who then freed and married her. Cliegg tells Anakin that she was abducted by Tusken Raiders weeks earlier and is likely dead. Determined to find his mother, Anakin ventures out and finds her at the Tusken campsite, still barely alive. After she dies in his arms, an enraged Anakin massacres the tribe. He later declares to PadmÃ© that he will find a way to prevent the deaths of those he loves, though these powers are linked to the dark side and are forbidden techniques for Jedi.
On Geonosis, Obi-Wan discovers a Separatist gathering led by Count Dooku, who is developing a droid army with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray and ordered the attempts on PadmÃ©'s life. Obi-Wan transmits his findings to the Jedi Council but is captured by Separatist droids. Dooku meets Obi-Wan in his cell and explains his role in the Confederacy of Independent Systems' formation, while implying that a large portion of the Galactic Senate is under the control of his new master, Darth Sidious. He then invites Obi-Wan to join him and stop the Dark Lord of the Sith. When Obi-Wan refuses, Dooku claims that Obi-Wan's late master and Dooku's former apprentice Qui-Gon Jinn would have, had he been alive. Meanwhile, Senate Representative Jar Jar Binks proposes a successful vote to grant emergency powers to Chancellor Palpatine, allowing the clone army to be authorized.
Anakin and PadmÃ© head to Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan, but Anakin loses his lightsaber and they are captured by Jango. Dooku sentences the trio to death, but they are saved by a battalion of clone troopers led by Yoda, Mace Windu, and other Jedi. Windu beheads Jango during the ensuing battle. Obi-Wan and Anakin intercept Dooku, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Dooku injures Obi-Wan and severs Anakin's right arm, but Yoda intercepts and defends them. Dooku uses the Force to distract Yoda and escapes to Coruscant, where he delivers the plans of a super-weapon to Sidious, who addresses him by his Sith name Darth Tyranus. The Council is left disturbed by Dooku's claim of Sidious controlling the Senate. As the Jedi acknowledge the beginning of the Clone Wars,[b] Anakin is fitted with a robotic hand and marries PadmÃ© on Naboo, with C-3PO and R2-D2 as the only witnesses.

Star Wars: Episode III â Revenge of the Sith,Yes (VS),2005,Ubisoft,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","Above Coruscant, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker lead a mission to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the cyborg Separatist commander General Grievous.[a] After infiltrating Grievous' flagship, the Jedi battle Sith Lord Count Dooku, whom Anakin overpowers and decapitates at Palpatine's urging. Grievous escapes the battle-torn ship, which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant. 
Anakin reunites with his wife, PadmÃ© Amidala, who reveals that she is pregnant. While initially excited, Anakin soon begins to have nightmares about PadmÃ© dying in childbirth. Palpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his personal representative. The Council, suspicious of Palpatine, approve the appointment, but decline to grant Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and instead instruct him to spy on Palpatine, diminishing Anakin's trust in the Jedi. 
Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord behind the war, appoints Grievous as the new Separatist leader and orders him to relocate the Separatist Council to the volcanic planet Mustafar. Obi-Wan travels to Utapau, where he kills Grievous, and Yoda travels to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk to defend it from a Separatist invasion. Meanwhile, Palpatine tempts Anakin with his knowledge of the Force, including the power to prevent death, which he offers to teach him to save PadmÃ©'s life. Anakin deduces that Palpatine is Sidious and reports his treachery to Mace Windu, who confronts and subdues him. Desperate to save PadmÃ©'s life, Anakin severs Windu's hand before he can kill Palpatine, who sends Windu falling to his death. Anakin pledges himself to the Sith, and Palpatine knights him Darth Vader.
Palpatine then issues Order 66, which commands the clone troopers to kill their commanding Jedi officers, thus sending the Jedi Order into near-extinction. Meanwhile, Vader and a battalion of clone troopers kill the remaining Jedi in the Jedi Temple, after which Vader travels to Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders. Palpatine declares himself Emperor before the Galactic Senate, transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire, and denounces the Jedi as traitors. Having survived the chaos, Obi-Wan and Yoda return to Coruscant and view footage of Anakin battling Jedi in the Temple. Yoda orders Obi-Wan to confront Vader while he faces Palpatine.
When PadmÃ© learns of Anakin's treachery, she travels to Mustafar â with Obi-Wan stowing away on her ship â and implores Vader to abandon the dark side, but he refuses. Sensing Obi-Wan's presence, and thinking that they are conspiring to kill him, Vader angrily uses the Force to strangle PadmÃ© to unconsciousness. Obi-Wan then engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that ends with Obi-Wan severing Vader's legs and left arm. Obi-Wan retrieves Vader's lightsaber and leaves him for dead at the bank of a lava flow.
On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Yoda then flees with Senator Bail Organa and regroups with Obi-Wan and PadmÃ© on the planetoid Polis Massa. There, PadmÃ© gives birth to twins, whom she names Luke and Leia, and dies soon after, having lost her will to live. On Mustafar, Palpatine retrieves a barely-alive Vader and takes him to Coruscant, where his mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. Palpatine tells Vader that he killed PadmÃ© in a blind rage, devastating him.
Obi-Wan and Yoda plan to conceal the twins from the Sith and go into exile until the time is right to challenge the Empire. As PadmÃ©'s funeral takes place on her homeworld of Naboo, Palpatine and Vader supervise the construction of the Death Star. Bail takes Leia to his homeworld of Alderaan, where he and his wife adopt her, while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-uncle and aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, on Tatooine before going into exile to watch over the boy.

Steel Empire|Koutetsu Teikoku from Hot-BJP,,2005,Starfish,Zoo Digital Publishing,"PAL, JP","The game has a steampunk-inspired setting, during the year ""18XX"" of the ""Age of Steel"", ""an age almost familiar"". In the earlier game materials, this is explained as being the 19th century of an alternate history. However, in some later game materials, it is explained alternatively as a possible future scenario in which the world has been depleted of resources, forcing most of the world back to steam power. Most materials, including the original Japanese versions, hold the alternate 19th century explanation to be the case.[4] In this ""Age of Steel"", mammoth, floating, steam-powered battleships cruise the skies and gigantic armored locomotives carry cannons the size of railway cars. A military coup has occurred in the world's largest city, Dama (""Dama"" in Asian markets, ""Damd"" in English versions) and power-hungry dictator, industrialist and robber baron General Styron (""Styron"" in English versions, ""Sauron"" in Asian markets) rules by brute force and military might, his Goliath-like defenses carrying armor-piercing missiles and lethal aerial mines. With none strong enough to stand up against him, Styron sets his vision of steel and steam on the whole planet.
General Styron's Steel Empire are commonly called the Motorheads by their subjects and enemies alike, due to the Steel Empire's emblem of a blue-grey, steel, mustachioed colossal head, sometimes emitting steam. Although the Motorheads have conquered and enslaved most of the world, one small independent republic remains free and defiant. This is the Republic of Silverhead, placed far from the reach of the Steel Empire, centered in Antarctica, and where some of the greatest minds in the world have fled from Styron's tyranny. Silverhead is impressively ahead of its time in technology however; whereas the Motorheads still rely on steam power, dynamite and coal burning with almost religious zeal, Silverhead has perfected sustainable energy, geothermal energy, and even cold fusion. If the wider world were to also harness the power of lightning and the atom, it could pose a threat to Styron's coal and steam-based status quo, and so all ""abominations of nature"" the dictator would see ended.
Silverhead have a small yet elite air force, whose symbol is a silver eagle with a star between its wings. Although dwarfed in number by the legions of Motorhead, are Silverheads renowned for both the advanced technology of their aircraft and the aerial skill of their pilots. The Silverhead air force is also feared for the ""Imamio Thunder"" â known as the ""Lightning Bomb"" to Silverhead's enemies â which is more powerful than anything in Motorhead's arsenal. Silverhead are the last hope for freedom, and they alone have the will, and the weapons, to bring about Motorhead's downfall.
The player is a Silverhead pilot, launched from their titanic-sized, airborne, propelled aircraft carrier Rheinhalt, and has a choice of two different class of aircraft for each mission. The game begins with the Motorhead Empire attacking the mining city of Rahl, an ally of Silverhead in southern Patagonia,[5] and the player is tasked with retaking it. A further several missions will take the player into the vast subterranean (and partially submerged) caverns of Liedengel where Motorhead is gathering a surprise attack force against Silverhead; Sky District Zektor; and the foremost defenses of the Steel Empire â the heavily fortified Gardandi Islands, which lay in front of Dama, Motorhead's capital city.[6] The final assault occurs in the heart of Motorhead, the steampunk metropolis of Dama, and within the cavernous Germburn Fortress. Finally, after General Styron has launched himself into orbit via space cannon, the player must pursue him and his flagship past the atmosphere and into space. Styron's flagship unfurls into a solar sail-powered, monstrously-powered, flaming leviathan, and the last battle takes place over the moon.[7] If the player is victorious, Styron's ship is shown crashing to the moon; the credits play; and ""The End"" shows over a bleak lunar surface beneath the glowing Earth. The player/Silverhead craft is nowhere to be seen, however, leaving the fate of the protagonist unconcluded.
","Steel Empire is a multi-directional scrolling shooter. Gameplay is linear in that the player is restricted to flying in only one direction, and the player will meet enemies in a predesignated order. However, unlike many scrolling shooters, Steel Empire allows the player to fire from behind as well as ahead. Players are given a certain number of lives and continues, with higher difficulty levels granting more continues but with fewer lives per continue. If the player's ship's health is completely depleted a life is subtracted, with play continuing normally. If all lives are lost (including the ""zeroeth"" life) the player must use a continue, which will restart at either the beginning or midpoint of a stage depending on how far the player was when they continued; as such, the stages are divided into ""A"" and ""B"" sections for purposes of the high score table. Continuing also zeroes the player's score. When all continues are expended, the game is over.
Small blasts of explosive directed energy are used by the aircraft fighters of Silverhead as a form of standard, unlimited ammunition; although this is not greatly effective against the majority of the heavily armored forces of the Steel Empire and its allies, and is virtually ineffective against the bosses and mini-bosses. Players have the ability to collect powerups by flying into them, although the best tend to be in hard-to-reach places, or in the center of enemy formations, or dropped by the bigger, and tougher enemies. These powerups include:
Steel Empire features a kind of leveling-up system; every three powerups increase the player's firepower strength by one level, up to a maximum of 20. If the player uses a continue, their level is retained and enemies will continue to drop powerups. Designer Yoshinori Satake explained that this system was designed to favor unskilled players by allowing them to level up more if they were stuck; it was originally planned to have 40 levels, but his superior pointed out that players did not need to be at level 40 to beat the game and most would never see it.[8]
Gameplay focuses on combat with enemy aircraft, ground units and other assorted enemies and obstacles through seven progressively harder levels, each containing one or more bosses, which must be defeated in order to advance to the next level. The levels also feature less powerful minibosses, which appear about halfway through each level. Examples of typical enemies include small, steam-powered planes with flapping wings; ground-based railway tanks armed with cannons; kamikaze Motorheads propelled on what are essentially giant fireworks; and steam-powered windmills that launch themselves into the air propelling missiles. The bosses and mini-bosses include larger and more heavily armored rare enemies such as flying ironclads, and gigantic, steampunk-inspired mechanical golems.
As a pilot in Silverhead's air force, launched from Silverhead's giant, propelled, flying aircraft carrier ""Rheinhalt"", the player can choose to fly one of two classes of fighter aircraft. Both the Striker and the Z-01 are adaptable, as evidenced through the game; can become submarine, as evident in the third stage; and are even capable of leaving the atmosphere and functioning and sustaining their pilots for some time in the vacuum of space, as evidenced by the final stage.
One of the two options is the eagle-like ""Striker"" â a small, light, swift and maneuverable attack aircraft. As well as the standard energy-based ammunition of Silverhead aircraft to fire ahead and to the rear, the Striker will launch secondary blasts diagonally down towards ground-based targets, an advantage not shared with the other craft available. This qualifies the Striker for being more a ground-attack orientated aircraft. In the Japanese version, the Striker is called the Etopirika after the Japanese crested puffin.
The other option of craft available to the player is the ""Z-01"" or ""ZEP-01""; the first line of the code being ""Zeppelin"", a reference to the fact the Z-01 is a form of rigid airship. Unlike most Zeppelins, however, the Z-01 does not rely on gas or wind for movement, but with advanced energy maneuvering rockets, and is significantly armored. Compared to the Striker, the Z-01 is larger, and therefore a bigger target, and is slower; yet is significantly tougher and more durable, being able to take more punishment from enemy firepower. The Z-01s specialty is aerial mines launched upward, which fall further away in a wide crest motion; this makes it more suited to skyward assaults than the Striker, and qualifies it as more of an interceptor aircraft. The Z-01 also has a bigger ammo capacity, being able to hold spinning bombs and bouncing bombs.

Street Fighter Alpha 3|Street Fighter Zero 3 UpperJP,Yes (VS),2002,Crawfish Interactive,Capcom,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 discards the ""Manual"" and ""Auto"" modes from the previous Alpha games and instead offers three different playing styles known as ""isms"" for the player to choose from. The standard playing style, A-ism (or Z-ism in Japan), is based on the previous Alpha games, in which the player has a three-level Super Combo gauge with access to several Super Combo moves. X-ism is a simple style based on Super Street Fighter II Turbo (the term ""X-ism"" being a reference to that game's Japanese title, Super Street Fighter II X), in which the player has a single-level Super Combo gauge and access to a single but powerful Super Combo move. The third style, V-ism (or ""variable"" style), is a unique style that allows the player to perform custom combos similar to the ones in Street Fighter Alpha 2, but cannot use Super Combos. In X-ism, the player cannot air-block nor perform Alpha Counters, and can only use 1 Super Combo move in its powerful Level 3 version. To activate V-ism's Super Combo, the player has to press both kick and punch of the same strength. X-ism has the highest attack power but least defence, A-ism has more attack power than V-ism and a similar level of defence. All three modes have variations of movesets for each character, adding considerable depth to the gameplay. In addition, there are hidden modes that add handicaps to the player as well as benefits (for example, Classic mode, which prevents the use of Super Combos but also makes the character unable to be knocked in the air and juggled).
Alpha 3 also introduces a ""Guard Power Gauge"" which depletes each time the player blocks â if the gauge is completely depleted, then the player will remain vulnerable to an attack. When broken the bar shrinks and is refilled to its new maximum, it can be shrunk a number of times. Worth noting, while in X-Ism the character has the least defence of all modes it also has the largest guard bar, vice versa for V-ism with A-Zism being in the middle. Also the guard bar varies between characters, Zangief e.g. has a very large guard bar. The guard bar does not exist in Dramatic Battle matches so no guard crushing is possible there.
I-ism is a customizable style exclusive to the Dreamcast version's Saikyo Dojo mode and the PSP version's World Tour mode.

The controls for several actions have been modified from the previous Alpha games. For example, the level of a Super Combo move in A-ism is now determined by the strength of the attack button pressed (i.e. Medium Punch or Kick for a Lv. 2 Super Combo), rather than the number of buttons pushed; and throwing is now done by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously.

Stuart's relationship with George is strained further after Stuart accidentally crashes a model airplane he and George were creating in the house. Stuart's adoptive father, Frederick, tries to encourage him, telling him that ""every cloud has a silver lining.""
Later, Margalo, an apparently injured canary, falls into Stuart's roadster as he is driving home from school. Stuart invites Margalo to stay with his family for a while. However, Margalo is secretly assisting her master, a greedy falcon, to steal valuables from households. Orphaned as a fledgling, Margalo grows reluctant to steal from the Littles and becomes close friends with Stuart. The Falcon threatens to kill Stuart unless Margalo steals Eleanor's wedding ring. Concerned for Stuart's safety, Margalo complies.
When the Littles discover that Eleanor's ring is missing, they think it has fallen down their kitchen sink. Stuart offers to be lowered down the drain on a string to get it, but the string breaks, causing him to fall. Margalo saves Stuart and leaves the Littles' house that night in order to protect him. The next day, Stuart assumes Margalo has been kidnapped by the Falcon and decides to rescue her with the help of the Littles' cat Snowbell. Before he leaves, Stuart asks George to lie about his whereabouts to his parents.
Following advice from Snowbell's alley cat friend Monty, Stuart and Snowbell discover that the Falcon resides in the Pishkin Building. There, Stuart confronts the Falcon. Margalo assures Stuart that although she was following the Falcon's orders, she is still his friend. Stuart begs Margalo to come home with him, but the Falcon refuses to let Margalo quit her job. Despite Stuart's attempt to attack the Falcon, he drops Stuart over the side of the building, although Stuart survives by landing in a passing garbage truck. The Falcon captures Margalo and imprisons her in a paint can as punishment. However, Snowbell, who has become worried about Stuart, makes his way to the building and finds Margalo while the Falcon is absent.
At the same time, Stuart awakens on a garbage barge that was leaving New York and considers giving up until he finds his and George's broken yet still-functioning model airplane on the barge. Cobbling it together using various pieces of trash, Stuart repairs the plane and escapes back to New York City to rescue Margalo. Meanwhile, the Littles discover George has lied (he told them Stuart was sleeping at his friend Will's house for a school play) because Stuart is nowhere to be found.
They want to know where he is and this time, the truth. When George says he isn't sure where Stuart is Frederick angrily reveals it is never okay for George to lie. When George asks if it's wrong to break a promise to Stuart Eleanor reveals it's wrong to promise Stuart that he'll lie to them. Frederick wants George to listen to the tone of his voice. He wants George to tell them where Stuart is. When George says it was a promise (brother to brother) Frederick says he understands and that if he had a brother he'd do the same, but if he had promised him anything and found out he was in danger that would matter more to him than the promise. When Eleanor asks George how he'd feel and how they would feel if something happened to Stuart George confesses Stuart was last seen at the Pishkin Building, but when George asks if he's in trouble, Frederick says he's not just in trouble, he's in big trouble and they head out to find Stuart.
Meanwhile, Snowbell frees Margalo from the paint can, but the Falcon arrives and attacks him. As he tries to push Snowbell off the building, the Falcon is intercepted by Margalo, who threatens to toss the ring off the roof if he kills Snowbell. Before the Falcon could reclaim the ring from Margalo, Stuart swoops in on his plane to catch her. The Falcon catches up to the two in Central Park, while the Littles and Snowbell follow them. Stuart succeeds in blinding the Falcon by reflecting sunlight off his mother's ring before jumping from the plane, which crashes into Falcon, clipping his wings and causing him to fall in the trash can below, where Monty presumably eats him. Margalo safely brings Stuart back to the Littles and returns Eleanor's ring while Snowbell also reunites with them. Sometime later, Margalo says goodbye to the Littles and leaves to migrate south for the winter.

In Stuntman Career, the player must attempt a series of car chase stunt scenes. Each track has several stunts, which are indicated with visual cues and in voice. The player must complete each track in a limited time and with a specified accuracy of the stunts to be able to proceed to the next scene.[2] After all the scenes of the film are completed, a theatrical trailer of the film is shown that combines pre-rendered scenes with highlights from the car scenes based on the actual performance of the player. After succeeding a scene, the player is rewarded with money based on accuracy and time, and unlocking of vehicles and tools for the construction mode. After completing a scene, the player can watch a playback and optionally save it.[3]
The career mode allows the player to participate in six films, each filmed in a different location and in a different genre. Toothless in Wapping is a gangster film made in London and resembles Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (both of which were directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Jason Statham). A Whoopin' and a Hollerin' is inspired by Dukes of Hazzard set in rural Louisiana. Blood Oath is filmed in Bangkok and is inspired by John Woo-films. Conspiracy is a Tom Clancy-type thriller where the player uses a snowmobile in Switzerland. The Scarab of Lost Souls is based on the Indiana Jones films where the player uses a jeep and troop carrier in Egypt. Live Twice for Tomorrow is a parody of James Bond where the player uses sports cars in Monaco. Between films, the player must perform stunts in front of crowds at a stadium.[2][3]
The Stunt Construction mode allows the player to create their own stunts by placing equipment in an arena and then perform the stunts.[3] The Driving Games mode involves tests of vehicle control, such as maneuverability, precision and timing.[4]

The Sum of All Fears,,2002,Red Storm Entertainment,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","During the first day of the Yom Kippur War, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) prepares to conduct a tactical nuclear strike to stave off defeat. The necessity for the strike is averted, but an Israeli copy of a Mark 12 nuclear bomb is accidentally left on an A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft flown by Captain Mutti Zadin, which is subsequently shot down over Syria near Kafr Shams.  The nuclear weapon is lost, buried in the field of a Druze farmer. Eighteen years later, an Israeli police captain (coincidentally the brother of the downed pilot) converts to a fundamentalist sect of Hasidic Judaism after discovering his wife had an extramarital affair and attempts to instigate a violent demonstration of Palestinians at the Temple Mount. When the demonstrators unexpectedly conduct a peaceful protest, Zadin orders the police to fire tear gas and rubber bullets at the protesters anyway, and kills the leader of the demonstration by shooting him point-blank. The United States finds itself unable to diplomatically defend Israel, yet knows it cannot withdraw its support without risk of destabilizing the Middle East.
Following the advice of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) Jack Ryan, National Security Advisor Dr. Charles Alden enacts a plan to accelerate the peace process by converting Jerusalem into a Vatican-like independent city-state to be administered by a tribunal of Jewish, Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox religious leaders, and secured by an independent contingent of the Swiss Guards. As a nod to Israel, the U.S. Army supplies the IDF with more sophisticated equipment and agrees to construct a training base in the Negev Desert run by the U.S. Army's tank warfare specialists and the revived 10th Cavalry Division. To everyone's surprise, Ryan's plan seems to work, in large part due to Ryan's meetings with officials in Israel and Saudi Arabia and the acquiescence of the reformist President Andrey Narmonov in the democratized Soviet Union. With their religious contentions appeased, the factions in the Middle East find it much easier to negotiate their disputes.
However, the foreign affairs advisor Elizabeth Elliot holds a grudge against Ryan and Alden and maneuvers against them. She first takes Alden's job as National Security Advisor by using advantage of a sex scandal involving a child fathered by Alden out of wedlock, with the stress contributing to Alden's death in a severe stroke that causes a blowout fracture. She next begins a sexual relationship with the widowed President J. Robert Fowler, and manipulates him to publicly omit Ryan's role in the peace settlement and take credit for himself. After Ryan  accuses her of wishing to silence an American opponent of the deal, Elliot engineers a smear campaign accusing Ryan of engaging in an extramarital affair, fathering a child with a young widow. Jack's friends, agents John Clark and Domingo Chavez, convince Ryan's wife Cathy that the allegations are false (Jack's alleged mistress is Carol Zimmer, widow of Buck Zimmer, who was killed during Ryan and Clark's mission to rescue Chavez and army friends from Colombia in Clancy's preceding novel, Clear and Present Danger). Ryan later decides to retire from the CIA, but not before he puts together a covert operation to uncover corrupt dealings between Japanese and Mexican government officials.
Meanwhile, a small group of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorists, enraged at the looming failure of their jihad against Israel, come across the lost Israeli bomb and use it to construct their own weapon, using the bomb's plutonium as fissile material. The terrorists enlist the help of disaffected East German physicist Manfred Fromm, who agrees to the plot to exact revenge for his former communist country's reunification as a capitalist democratic state. With Fromm's expertise, the terrorists enhance the weapon and turn it into a thermonuclear device. The terrorists agree to detonate the weapon during the Super Bowl in Denver, Colorado, which is planned to coincide with a false flag attack on U.S. forces in Berlin by East Germans disguised as Soviet soldiers, aiming to begin a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The East Germans hope that the war will eliminate both superpowers and punish the Soviets for betraying World Socialism, while the Palestinians hope the attack will destroy the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and end U.S. aid to Israel.
Thinking his work is done, the Palestinians kill Fromm. However, Fromm had not yet told them that some of the material he planned to use needed to be purified first. The Palestinians finish the bomb assembly and when it is used, the impure material causes the weapon to fizzle. However, almost everyone at the Super Bowl is killed, including the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the commander of NORAD. With the corresponding attacks in Berlin, the United States briefly assumes DEFCON-1 status as Fowler and Elliott prepare for a nuclear war. The crisis is averted by Ryan, who learns of the domestic origin for the bomb's plutonium, gains access to the hot line, and convinces the Soviet President to stand down his country's military.
When the terrorists are captured and interrogated by Clark in Mexico City, they implicate the Iranian ayatollah in the attack. President Fowler orders the Ayatollah's residence in the holy city of Qom to be destroyed by a nuclear strike. Ryan averts the attack by enforcing the two-man rule. The terrorists are delivered to the FBI field office in Buzzard Point, where Ryan questions them. During questioning, Ryan falsely asserts that Qom was destroyed, tricking Qati into revealing that Iran was not involved, and that their deceit was meant to discredit the United States and destroy the peace process, allowing the campaign against Israel to continue. Elliot is hospitalized after suffering a nervous breakdown, while Fowler leaves office and is succeeded by his Vice President, Roger Durling (it is implied that Fowler was removed from office through the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, but a later novel clarifies that Fowler resigned in disgrace, while Elliott was forcibly removed).
The terrorists are executed by beheading in Riyadh by the commander of the Saudi Arabian special forces using an ancient sword owned by the Saudi royal family. Later, the sword is presented to Ryan as a gift. In the sequels, the gift (combined with his origins as a Marine) inspires Ryan's Secret Service codename of ""Swordsman"".

Summon Night: Swordcraft Story|Summon Night: Craft Sword MonogatariJP,Yes,2004JP2006NA,Flight-Plan,Atlus,"NA, JP","Three years ago, Shintetsu, the Craftlord of Iron (one of the seven Craftlords), gave up his life to protect his wife Amariss, their child, and the whole of Wystern, and was honored as a hero for his sacrifice. Three years later, the remaining Craftlords organized a tournament to replace the role of Craftlord of Iron. The player takes on the role of the child of Shintetsu, and fights to earn the title in honor of his/her father. However, the foreign nation of Deigleya have plans of their own, as well as a thousand-year-old forbidden secret that was the truth behind the tournament.
The child of Shintetsu fights through the tournament and wins every match presented to him/her, however, strange natural disasters are affecting nearby settlements, and earthquakes are prevalent throughout Wystern. A mysterious figure follows the child of Shintetsu throughout his/her journey, and eventually presents him/her with the Western Sword. The Western Sword was once used to seal a great evil, but the player becomes entrusted with the weapon once the seal became ineffective. Before the tournament can be concluded, the player learns of a building unrest among the craftlords, and discovers Lubert, Craftlord of Amber, and Ureksa, Craftlord of Jade, are attempting to harness the power of the destructive spirit Parista, and have struck a deal with the neighboring warfaring nation of Deigleya in exchange for sharing control of the beast. It is later discovered that Ureksa was the brother to the former Craftlord of Jade, Rumari, and it was because of Rumari that Parista had accidentally been awoken three years ago. The Western Sword, along with the Eastern and Northern Swords, were crafted by Shintetsu in order to seal Parista once more, but upon learning these three swords would be ineffective, he poured his own soul into a fourth sword, the Southern Sword, and sacrificed himself in the process. The player learns that the tournament in order to take the place of the Craftlord of Iron was simply a distraction for the populace while the Craftlord circle fought amongst themselves for a plan of action in dealing with the beast of destruction, Parista. While Parista was the spirit of fire, the spirit Kuhrya was the spirit of ice and the polar opposite of Parista, and guarded the Southern blade until the child of Shintetsu would claim it and send Parista back into the spirit world. Upon gaining the final blade, the player enters the final battle with the spirit Parista, and fulfills his/her destiny. While the tournament was simply a formality, the player earns his/her place as the Craftlord of Iron and saves the world from destruction.
","Summon Night: Swordcraft Story progresses through the story on a day-by-day basis. The entire game consists of 10 days, where the player traverses through the town of Wystern and the Labyrinth Dungeon. Each day, more levels of the Labyrinth are unlocked and the player is required to travel deeper to complete mandatory quests. A day normally ends after a tournament or boss battle. During the night, the player can choose whom to spend the night with, which will control the following cutscene.
Apart from the story quests, there are multiple side-quests, offered by re-occurring NPCs. Often, they are simple fetch quests. The rewards of these quests are usually enchanted weapon techniques.
One of the main focuses of the game is to forge weapons for fighting. To forge a weapon, the player needs the weapon technique and the materials to create it. Sword techniques are given once every day by Bron and are impossible to miss. Other weapon techniques can also be received from Bron, but the preceding weapon must already have been crafted in order for him to teach the next technique. Also, as with swords, Bron will add to the number of techniques by each day. After the main game is completed, the player will receive techniques by finding them in treasure chests or monsters, and completing special tasks.
Summon Night divides materials into four elements: fire, water, lightning, and wind. Materials can be obtained by sacrificing items or weapons. The amount and type of materials received will depend on the items being used. Also, any weapon sacrificed will only return half of what was used to forge it. When the player has the technique, as well as the materials necessary, they may forge the weapon at their workshop. Weapons can also be enchanted. Depending on what guardian beast was selected, different types of weapons may be enchanted without having to obtain the enchanted technique. Creating an enchanted weapon will require that the original form of the weapon was already forged. In addition, the player must have the proper amount of mystic ores. Mystic ores can be obtained by defeating a special group of enemies, which take the form of possessed armor and equipment. When the player selects to create the weapon again, the option of using mystic ores will be given. Enchanted weapons have increased statistics in comparison to their original form, and they are also endowed by one of the four elements. The weapons that cannot be enchanted by the guardian beast will require the completion of a side-quest.
Battles in Summon Night take place inside dungeons. They are initiated as random encounters. On the battle scene, the player will be placed into a small side-scrolling area with one to four opponents. They are able to walk, run, jump, guard, attack, summon their guardian beast and use items. Up to three weapons can be equipped, and up to four different items and spells can be placed onto the guardian beast. This must be set up before a battle begins. If no weapon is available or equipped, the player will be forced to battle with a hammer. During the battle, the player can switch freely between their equipped weapons and use any of the selected items and spells. A battle is won when all opponents have either fled or have been defeated.
The character has three statistics which determine his or her ability to fight. Strength controls the amount of damage they inflict. Defense controls the amount of damage opponents will inflict. Agility controls speed while moving, and jumping height. These stats can be increased by equipment or leveling up. The game also uses a health point system, which will be increased automatically upon level up. Hit points are also gained in varying amounts depending on which stats were selected to increase.
Each weapon also has a score akin to hit points, called duration. Each attack will decrease the duration of the weapon very slightly. If duration of a weapon hits zero, the weapon will break and will no longer be usable. When a weapon breaks, it leaves behind a weapon shard and cannot be restored. Duration is refilled after every battle. The rate which a weapon's duration decreases is inversely proportional to the weapon's TEC score. TEC can be increased by fighting with the weapon more often.

The character aspires to be a Craftknight as well. The player character, either Edgar Colthearts or Aera Colthearts, who are Edge Fencers, find themselves at the site of an abandoned ruin, where a violent Summon Beast named Goura is awakened. In order to protect their new family, Edgar/Aera is bound to a wild Summon Beast (stray summon) and embarks on a journey to reseal the ruins.
As the new swordcrafter and his/her Summon Beast goes on their adventure, they start to learn more about the ruins, the monster inside, and most important, his/her father's past, along with a mysterious power infused in his/her body and soul. Fighting monsters, going to strange and exotic places and meeting all sort of creatures, humans and spirits, the quest starts shaping the character to maturity and courage.
","The player explores the world from a top-down perspective.  In areas containing enemies, groups of foes will randomly appear to confront the player, switching the game to combat mode. A variety of objects are placed in the areas that the player explores.  The player may interact with these objects by striking them with a weapon. Most of these objects are breakable, and the player will randomly obtain helpful items from them. These objects will reappear once the player leaves the area and returns.  There are also normal chests, which contain a specific item and can only be obtained once. Different weapon types also have unique uses, such as the ability of knuckles to move boulders, drills to break down walls, spears to obtain items from trees, swords to cut off large grass, axes to destroy stumps, and the character's own hammer to push buttons located on the ground or the floor. Proper use of weapon types is needed to solve the game's puzzles.[1]
Battles in Summon Night: Swordcraft Story 2 are 2D sidescrolling affairs.  All action takes place in real-time. Players may have up to three weapons equipped and may switch between the three at will during a fight.  Players may also choose from a pre-selected set of spells and items to use as well.  As the player fights, the durability of their equipped weapon will go down.  When durability is fully depleted, the weapon breaks and is not usable until repaired.  If the player has no more usable weapons equipped, then the player is forced to switch to the hammer.
The health of all enemies is constantly displayed at the top of the screen with numbered red meters.  Players defeat enemies by reducing their health to nothing.  Some enemies carry weapons like the player.  When fighting these enemies, a Durability meter for their weapon will appear in addition to their health meter.  These enemies may be defeated by depleting either their health or weapon durability.  In the case of the latter, the player will receive the same crafting material  their opponent had in his/her weapon, not including the shape stone.
In this game, players create their own weapons through a crafting process.  To create a weapon, the player must first have an item, called a Shapestone, of one of five varieties â sword, axe, spear, knuckle, or drill.  A craft material is added to a shapestone to create a usable weapon; which material is used determines the strength of the weapon that is created. After obtaining a certain skill level in crafting, the player will gain the ability to upgrade weapons with additional materials.  This may result in the weapon gaining special qualities. Players have the option to disassemble weapons they have created to retrieve the Shapestone used to make it.  The Shapestone may retain some of the power of the weapon it was disassembled from. Any materials used to create or upgrade the disassembled weapon are lost. Repairing is the most important of all. It recovers all the lost DUR from all the weapons you have. It can also repair weapons which already have a 0 DUR.

Super Collapse! II,,2002,GameHouse,Majesco Entertainment,,NaN,"The classic Collapse! game is played on a board of twelve columns by fifteen rows. Randomly colored blocks fill the board, rising from below. By clicking on a group of 3 or more blocks of the same color, the whole group disappears in a collapse and any blocks stacked above fall down to fill in the vacant spaces. If a whole column is cleared, the elements slide to the center of the field. If one or more blocks rise beyond the top row of the board, the game is lost. If the player manages to survive a specified number of lines without losing, they win the level and are awarded points for successful completion.[2]
A level usually begins with a few rows of blocks using a starting set of colors (typically red, green, blue, white, and yellow.). One after the other, new blocks are added to a ""feed"" row below the board. When the feeder row has filled, all of its blocks are moved up, to the active board, shifting the field of remaining blocks higher. During the course of a level, the rate of new blocks entering the feed increases. New colors may also be introduced, making it more challenging for the player to find groups that are large enough to be collapsed.
In higher levels of the game, ""bombs"" appear, mixed among the blocks. The bombs are black (in which case clicking on them causes the surrounding blocks to disappear), or are the color of one of the groups of bricks (in which case clicking on the bomb eliminates all bricks on the board that are the same color). Black bombs have the additional quality of serving as a bridge between bricks of the same color; if two or more bricks of the same color are touching a bomb, then clicking one of those bricks has the same effect of clicking on a group of three or more bricks of the same color. In Super Collapse 3!, this rule is changed to allow colored bombs to act as a bridge between matching groups.
When a player completes a certain number of ""even-numbered"" levels (i.e., from level 2, 4, 8, 10, 14 and 16), a bonus level is played. Here, the player has 15 seconds to completely clear a screenful of bricks and earn extra points.

After making it to Sardius's castle, Arthur must return to the beginning where the Princess hid the bracelet in order to destroy Sardius permanently. After repeating his journey, Arthur defeats Sardius with the bracelet and returns the Princess to the kingdom.
","Arthur starts the game with an ordinary suit of armor, which may be upgraded up to three times. The first upgrade is bronze armor which enhances Arthur's firepower. The second upgrade is golden armor which allows Arthur to charge his firepower to unleash special magic attacks. The golden armor comes with a shield which can block one projectile before breaking. The last upgrade is a better shield which can block up to three projectiles before breaking and allow Arthur's firepower to charge up quicker. No matter how upgraded, his armor falls off following any touch by an enemy, leaving Arthur defenseless and clad only in his underwear, at which point he will die if hit again. Shields can only block projectiles if Arthur is standing still.
Like in Ghouls n' Ghosts, hidden treasure chests can be found for weapons, armor upgrades, bonus points and sometimes unwanted traps such as bear traps and an evil magician who transforms Arthur. Treasure chests are hidden and can only be accessed by moving through specific areas of the screen, which causes them to appear.
One key feature is the double jump, which allows Arthur to leap into the air, and then leap again. However, the player has no direct control of Arthur's movement once in the air. The second jump can change direction, but that is the only control players have.

Each world has three levels, except World 7, which has two.[4]:6 Each world has a particular theme that dictates the obstacles and enemies encountered in its levels, such as desert areas with dangerous quicksand and snowy areas with slippery surfaces. Levels contain multiple sections or rooms that are connected via doors or ladders. Some rooms are accessible by entering certain jars. Magic potions found in each level are used to temporarily access ""Sub-space"", an inverted area where the player can collect coins and Mushrooms that increase the character's maximum health.

Other items available include cherries, which are collected in order to acquire a Starman; and the POW block, which can be used to quickly destroy all the enemies visible on the screen.[4]:17â21 The player must defeat a boss enemy at the end of each of the first six worlds, then defeat Wart himself at the end of World 7 to complete the game.
The player starts Super Mario Bros. 2 with three lives, which are lost each time the player's character loses all health from enemy or hazard damage or when the character falls off the screen. The player can replenish health by collecting floating hearts that appear upon defeating a certain number of enemies. The player will receive a Game Over upon losing the last life, though the player may continue up to twice in one game. Additional extra lives may be obtained by collecting hidden 1-Up Mushrooms or by using the coins collected from Sub-space to win the slot machine minigame played between the levels.[4]:9â10,19,22

Super Mario Advance 2,Yes (SPM),2002,Nintendo,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","After saving the Mushroom Kingdom in Super Mario Bros.Â 3, brothers Mario and Luigi decide to go on vacation to a place called Dinosaur Land, a prehistoric-themed world swarming with dinosaurs and other enemies. While resting on the beach, Princess Toadstool is captured by Bowser. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who tells them his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopalings. Mario and Luigi soon realise it must be the evil King Bowser Koopa and his Koopalings. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi set out to save Toadstool and Yoshi's dinosaur friends, traversing through Dinosaur Land for Bowser and his Koopalings. To aid him, Yoshi gives Mario a cape as they begin their journey. Mario and Luigi continue to follow Bowser, defeating the Koopalings in the process, and save Yoshi's dinosaur friends. They eventually arrive at Bowser's castle, where they fight him in a final battle. They send Bowser flying into the sky and save Toadstool, restoring peace to Dinosaur Land.
","Super Mario World is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls Mario or Luigi, the protagonists of the game. The game has similar gameplay to earlier games in the Super Mario seriesÂ â Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros.Â 2, and Super Mario Bros.Â 3Â â but introduces new elements. As well as running and jumping, the player can also fly or float with the aid of certain power-ups and can execute the new spin jump move.[7] The game has 96 level exits in total.[8][9][10][11][12]
The player navigates through the game via two game screens: an overworld map and a side-scrolling playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, ghost houses and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the world's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress allows access to that level's playfield. The majority of the game takes place in these linear levels, populated with obstacles and enemies, which involves the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies.[13] The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if Mario comes into contact with an enemy while small, falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or runs out of time.[14] The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player can continue from the most recent save point (a successfully completed castle, fortress or haunted house) by selecting ""Continue"".[15] Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; each of the seven worlds features fortresses controlled by one of the Koopalings,[16] and the player also battles Bowser in his castle in the seventh and final world.[17] Super Mario World includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the second controls his brother, Luigi.[18][10][11]
In addition to the power-ups from previous games, such as the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, Super Mario World has a new power-up named the Cape Feather, which gives Mario a cape and the ability to fly, glide in the air, and use the cape as a sail.[19] The game also introduces the ability to ""store"" an extra power-up in a box at the top centre of the screen. For example, if the player obtains a Fire Flower or a Cape Feather, then a Super Mushroom will appear in the box. If Mario gets hit by an enemy, the stored item in the box will automatically drop. Alternatively, the player can manually release the stored item at any time.[15][10][11]
The game introduces Yoshi, a dinosaur companion Mario can ride who is able to eat most enemies.[20] If Yoshi attempts to eat a Koopa or its shell, he can spit it out and fire it at enemies. If the player fails to spit the shell out within a certain amount of time, Yoshi will swallow it, rendering it useless. When holding any Koopa shell in his mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes him to emit dust clouds that kill nearby enemies, and a red shell allows him to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also has hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding it five enemies or one star, Super Mushroom, Fire Flower or Cape Feather, causing the baby Yoshi to mature.[21][10][11]
Although the main objective is to navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access a hidden world, the player needs to find keys scattered throughout the game's levels.[22] When a key is found, it must be brought to a keyhole to unlock either a new level or a Star Road.[23] Exploring these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently changes some of the enemies' sprites and alters the overworld map's colour scheme.[8][10][11]

Super Mario Advance 3,Yes (SPM),2002,Nintendo,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Yoshi's Island is a 2D side-scrolling platform game.[2][3] Its story begins as Kamek, a Magikoopa[4] in care of young Bowser, attacks a stork delivering baby brothers Mario and Luigi. They succeed in kidnapping Baby Luigi, but Baby Mario falls out of the sky and onto the back of Yoshi,[3] the friendly dinosaur.[5] The player controls one of many Yoshis, which take turns traveling through 48 levels across six worlds[6] to rescue Baby Luigi and reunite the brothers.[3] In the Super Mario series platform game tradition, the player controls Yoshi with a two-button run and jump control scheme. The player navigates between platforms and atop some foes en route to the end of the increasingly difficult levels. Yoshi also collects coins to earn extra lives[7] and retains his long tongue from Super Mario World.[2] The game centers more on ""puzzle-solving and item-collecting"" than other platformers,[5] with hidden flowers and red coins to find.[6] Levels include mines, ski jumps, and ""the requisite fiery dungeons"".[8] Every fourth level (two in each world[6]) is a boss fight against a large version of a previous foe.[5]
In a style new to the series,[8] the game has a coloring book aesthetic with ""scribbled crayon"" backgrounds, and Yoshi vocalizes with its every action.[6] Expanding on his ""trademark tongue"" ability to swallow enemies,[4] Yoshi, as the focus of the game, was given a new move set: the ability to ""flutter jump"", throw eggs, and transform. The flutter jump gives Yoshi a secondary boost when the player holds the jump button.[3] It became his new ""trademark move"", similar to that of Luigi in Super Mario Bros. 2. Yoshi can also pound the ground from mid-air to bury objects or break through soft earth, and use his long tongue to grab enemies at a distance.[7] Swallowed enemies can be spat as projectiles immediately or stored for later use as an egg.[3] The player individually aims and fires the eggs at obstacles via a new targeting system. The eggs also bounce off of surfaces in the environment. Up to six eggs can be stored this way, and will trail behind the character.[2] Yoshi can also eat certain items for power-up abilities. For instance, watermelons let Yoshi shoot seeds from his mouth like a machine gun, and fire enemies turn his mouth into a flamethrower. Other power-ups transform Yoshi into vehicles including cars, drills, helicopters, and submarines. A star power-up makes Baby Mario invulnerable and extra fast.[7]
While Yoshi is ""virtually invincible"", if hit by an enemy, Baby Mario will float off his back in a bubble while a timer counts down to zero. When the timer expires, Koopas arrive to take Baby Mario[3] and Yoshi loses a life.[9] The player can replenish the timer by collecting small stars[3] and power-ups.[5] However, Yoshi can also lose a life instantly if he comes into contact with obstacles such as pits, spikes, lava, and thorns.  Similar to Super Mario World, the player can hold a power-up in reserve, such as a ""+10 star"" (which adds ten seconds to the Baby Mario timer) or a ""magnifying glass"" (which reveals all hidden red coins in a level).[6] These power-ups are acquired in several minigames.[6] At the end of each level, the Yoshi relays Baby Mario to the successive Yoshi.[3] If the player perfects all eight levels in each world by finishing with all flowers, red coins, and full 30 seconds on the timer, two hidden levels will unlock.[7] There are three save slots on the cartridge.[3]
The Game Boy Advance version adds an exclusive bonus level for each world with 100% level completion.[6] It also includes four-player support via link cable,[3] but only to play Mario Bros., a pack-in feature also included on the other Super Mario Advance games.[6]

Super Puzzle Fighter II|Super Puzzle Fighter II XJP,,2003,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Capcom,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Puzzle Fighter is a puzzle game which is similar to the Sega arcade game Baku Baku Animal.[1] As in the Capcom arcade game Pnickies, the player controls pairs of blocks (""gems"" in game parlance) that drop into a pit-like playfield (twelve blocks tall by six blocks wide, with the fourth column from the left being thirteen blocks high). In Puzzle Fighter, however, gems can only be eliminated by coming into contact with a Crash Gem of the same color, which eliminates all adjacent gems of that color, setting up the potential for huge chain reactions. When gems are eliminated, ""garbage blocks"" called Counter Gems drop into the opponent's playfield; these will eventually become normal gems, but only after they count down to zero. Most Counter Gems start at ""5"" and are reduced by one each time a new pair of gems is dropped on that board. The only way to eliminate Counter Gems before they become normal gems is to place a Crash Gem of that color nearby so it eliminates at least one normal gem. If this is done, all Counter Gems immediately adjacent to the Crash Gem will be taken out as well. Additionally, gems of the same color that form squares or rectangles (of at least two blocks tall and wide) in the pit become a giant Power Gem of that size and color; eliminating these as part of a combo increases the number of Counter Gems that would otherwise normally appear on the opponent's board. The only other type of piece to appear is a diamond, which eliminates all the gemsânormal, Power, Counter, and Crash alikeâof whichever color gem it lands on. (This, too, will cause Counter Gems to appear on the opponent's board. The diamond is supposed to create half the number of Counter Gems as a normal chain reaction. However, there is a bug that allows players to bypass this reduction.[6]) The diamond piece appears every 25 pieces.
Puzzle Fighter borrowed rules originally found in Puyo Puyo 2 called Sousai (Garbage Countering). This will allow a player to counter and negate garbage being sent by the opponent with chains of their own. Sousai can also be used to send garbage back to the opponent, known as Garbage overflow.
During the game, super deformed versions of various characters from Capcom's two main fighting game series (Street Fighter and Darkstalkers) act out a comical battle based on how the game is going.[1] Every time one player sends Counter Gems to their opponent, their character will perform a typical fighting-game action, anything from a taunt to a special move. The more Counter Gems the player sends over, the ""bigger"" the move the character will perform. These animations, however, are purely cosmetic and have no actual bearing on the gameplay other than to indicate the magnitude of the counters.
The game continues until one player's field reaches the top of its fourth column (which is where all new gems first appear). That player is the loser.
The Dreamcast version of the game adds three separate modes: X-Mode, Y-Mode, and Z-Mode. Whereas X-mode is the original version of the core game, Y-Mode and Z-Mode have more drastic gameplay changes. Y-Mode makes the gems break as soon as three or more are aligned in a row, column, or diagonally, like in Columns, whereas Z-mode makes lines of gems rise up from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a 2x2 square cursor, with which they rotate already-placed pieces, similarly to Tetris Attack.

While both routes share similarities, each character has his own unique missions to follow, as well as meeting different people and piloting different mechs in their respective scenarios. Regardless of who the player chooses, both protagonists and their parties will eventually join up to form one large cast, with brief branching stages, based on the character chosen in the beginning of the game.
As a first in the Super Robot Wars franchise, Original Generation allows the player to equip or remove weapons on mechs. For example, the  Plasma Saber equipped on the Weiss Ritter can be removed and placed on the R-1 for its pilot to utilize during sorties. However, this unique system is only available on mechs that are of the real-type, while super robots are not capable of switching weapons but you can still equip a weapon that decreases movement, armor, weapon attack etc. The game also allows the use of customizing playable pilots, through a set of pilot skills, bought by Pilot Points, received from defeating enemy units. These Pilot Points can also upgrade their stats that determine how well he/she performs in battle as well as their terrain adaptivity.

The HUD featured new graphics. The original opening sequence and unused sequence, which had featured two generic characters fighting in front of a crowd, was replaced by a new opening featuring lead character Ryu launching a Hadouken projectile towards the screen, now intertwined with images of Chun-Li and Cammy, as well as brief flashes of the image of new hidden character Akuma. New animation frames were drawn for all the victory poses and the basic and special moves of the characters. For example, Chun-Li received a new animation for her KikÅken (fireball) projectile.
A large criticism of Super Street FighterÂ II was the slower game speed in comparison to the previous release, Street FighterÂ II: Hyper Fighting. Super Turbo was the first Street Fighter game released in arcades to feature an adjustable speed setting. The game speed can be adjusted through the system configuration by the game's operator or (if the speed setting is set to ""Free Select"") can be chosen by the player at the start of the game.

Sword of Mana|Shinyaku Seiken DensetsuJP,No,2003,Brownie Brown,Square Enix / Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP","Sword of Mana has a similar story to Final Fantasy Adventure with additional details and dialogue added. The player has the choice to follow the story of either the hero or the heroine, who are named by the player, instead of only the hero as in the original game. The two stories parallel each other, and the two protagonists are often together.
The hero's story begins with a flashback dream of the death of his parents at the hands of the Dark Lord, the ruler of the nation of Granz. Upon waking, the hero, a gladiator-slave in Granz, attempts to escape before being confronted by the Dark Lord and thrown off of a bridge. After being fished out of a lake, the hero is advised to head to the city of Topple. The heroine's story also begins with a flashback dream of the Dark Lord and his assistant, Julius, killing her stepmother and destroying her village. Upon awaking, she is advised by the knight Bogard to head to Topple, while he journeys to the city of Wendell. The hero and heroine meet in Topple, and agree to journey together. They head toward Wendell, and along the way discover that women of the Mana tribe, which the heroine belongs to, are being kidnapped by vampires. The heroine is kidnapped, and is rescued by the hero and an unnamed man; they discover that the kidnappings are to keep the woman safe from the Dark Lord and Julius, who are killing them all in part because the tribe was unable to save the Dark Lord's mother from a terrible fate.
In Wendell, the two protagonists learn that Bogard and several other knights were instrumental in overthrowing the Vandole Empire twenty years prior, which had been abusing Mana, the source of magic. The hero states his intention to find the legendary Mana Sword in order to avenge his parents and the heroine reveals she has a pendant from her stepmother that is the key to the Mana Tree, the source of Mana. The unnamed man then reveals himself to be Julius and kidnaps the heroine for the pendant; during a failed rescue attempt the hero falls from an airship along with the pendant. After a side story resulting in the hero and heroine killing the Dark Lord's mother, who had been turned into a monster, the pendant is stolen and given to the Dark Lord. The protagonists chase after him. After the two defeat the Dark Lord, Julius reveals himself to be the last survivor of the Vandole Empire. Once gaining the pendant he mind controlled the heroine to use the pendant to give him control the Mana Tree, which Vandole had attempted to do prior to being overthrown. Julius defeats the hero and heroine, and heads off to the Mana Tree.
The hero and heroine split up to find the Mana Sword. After the hero passes trials to prove himself worthy of the sword, which first appears as a rusty blade, the two join forces to storm the Mana Tree and defeat Julius. They do so, but the tree is killed in the process; prior to death, the tree reveals that she was the heroine's mother, and asks the heroine to replace her as the next Mana Tree. The heroine agrees, and the two protagonists part ways.
","The gameplay of Sword of Mana is an expanded and modified version of the gameplay of the action role-playing game Final Fantasy Adventure, with elements added from later games in the Mana series. Like previous games in the series, Sword of Mana displays a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Unlike the original game, the terrain is in color, is not composed of square tiles, and the player is not restricted to moving only in the cardinal directions. At the beginning of the game the player chooses to follow the story of either the unnamed hero or heroine, and controls them thereafter.[1] The player is often joined by either the unchosen protagonist or by temporary companions, and at any point during battles can choose to take direct control of the other party member instead of their chosen character. The non-selected character is controlled via artificial intelligence.[2] Unlike prior games in the series, Sword of Mana does not have a direct multiplayer component. Instead, players can connect their Game Boy Advances together via a Link Cable to give their characters powerful attacks to be used at a later time, known as the ""Amigo"" system. The original game featured no multiplayer capabilities.[1]
The two main characters have different capabilities. Both are capable of using weapons and magic, but the hero is stronger with melee weapons and the heroine is stronger with ranged magical attacks.[1] Weapons have three attributes: slash, jab, and bash; and different attributes cause more or less damage to different enemies. Magical spells can cause damage or defend the protagonists, and are affected by the weapon the character is holding. Combat takes place in real-time. Located at the bottom of the screen is an overdrive gauge that increases by one point at each hit given to an enemy. When that gauge is full, the player can release a powerful attack that will deplete the gauge completely if the attack lands. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion.[2]
The player can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The Ring Command menu, which lets the player pause the game in combat to select different weapons, spells, and items, was not present in the original game, but was present in the sequels Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana.[3] A version of the day-and-night system introduced in Trials of Mana was added to the game, whereby some enemies are only present at different times of day, which changes whenever the player enters a new area.[1] Much like Legend of Mana, players can forge weapons and plant produce in an orchard in the game's ""Hot House"" feature.[4]

Ovis is brutally oppressed by the knights of Lodis. Alphonse Loeher is a knight in Rictor Lasanti's military unit, the Order of the Sacred Flame, and he is sent to Ovis. When he is later separated from the main forces, he meets Eleanor Olato and Ivanna Batraal, two locals from whom he eventually learns the truth about the horrific events taking place in Ovis.
Various circumstances lead Alphonse to separate from Rictor's main unit. As the plot unfolds, Alphonse begins to question the actions and motives of Rictor. He then begins his search for answers, starting with Ivanna's uncle, the sinister regent Naris Batraal, and the sacred spear, Longicolnis, which is the only instrument that can pierce the skin of the sacred demon. It is later revealed that Rictor initially knew about the sacred spear and wanted to obtain it for the Lodis empire. About halfway through the game, the player is presented with two choices, which eventually leads to either his renewed trust or a falling out with Rictor. In fact, the player's choice will significantly affect all plot elements that follow.
After assaulting Naris Batraal's stronghold, it is revealed he is in league with the Fallen Angel, Shaher, who was imprisoned in Northern Ovis after being cast out from Heaven.  Longicolnis is actually his own demonic horn which is both the only thing which can break his invincible barrier, and what shall allow him to be freed from his icy prison and begin his conquest of Ovis and the outside world.
There are five possible endings in the game (the Game Over scenario, which is gained by losing to the final boss, is also counted). The ""A+"" ending sequence features one additional scene which details Lans Tartare's past, in addition to the entire ""A"" ending sequence. To view the A+ ending, several conditions must be met, including completing the game in under 25 hours. The exact ending sequence with which the game presents the player depends on, among other things, the significant choice that the player has made halfway through the game and Eleanor's presence in the final battle. In particular, the ""D"" ending excludes Eleanor altogether.
","Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis offers a strategic field-and-class based combat system. Although the player starts with a meager army of only six units (with the classes of those units being determined by questions the player answers in the beginning of the game), the army can later blossom to as many as thirty-two.
Each character is unique, being determined by several things: material statistics, of which there are only three, strength, intelligence, and agility; alignment, ranging from chaotic to lawful; and element, based on the four classical elements. Characters can also earn emblems, certificates given after performing a specific feat or reaching a certain checkpoint. These emblems sometimes have no effect, often alter character statistics, some have a negative effect, and a few are required to advance to certain classes.
The game's playable units are divided into several categories; humans, demi-humans, dragons, Beasts, the undead, transcended beings and denizens of the netherworld. The human class is the only category with interchangeable jobs, with each class being marked by a required, or multiple required statistics, and often an emblem. Some classes can only be unlocked by a certain sex, while other classes are reserved only for certain special characters.
Demi-humans, non-humans, and the undead cannot change classes. Although all categories of units in the game can be persuaded in battle, the undead alone cannot be bought. Instead, undead units are created by using a certain spell on deceased units. Dragons change classes in a unique way: after reaching several checkpoints in statistics, a dragon will instantly upgrade into a certain new class, with the class being determined by the dragon's alignment. Once a dragon has upgraded, altering its alignment will automatically change its class.
After customization of the player's party, the group of units (of which the max limit on any story-based level is eight, with quest-based levels having a restriction of five) engage in combat.
Battle takes place on a large, panel-based playing field. The area is composed of terrain types and various height levels, making movement a critical factor. There are several movement types, ranging from simple walking to airborne flight. A character's movement type is determined by the class of that unit, as well as various special equipment which can change movement type. Terrain levels range from basic dirt and grass, to water (in varying depths and types), to impassable terrain, such as lava or blank space.
In actual combat, there are also many variations. Simple melee combat can be performed, either barehanded or with single-ranged weapons, to adjacent panels. This means the attacking unit must be directly next to the target, making mobility a critical ability. Some weapons offer different attack ranges, such as the two-paneled pierce attack of spear and lance weaponry, to the two-paneled selective attack range of the whip.
Ranged attacks require the use of either a bow weapon, or a special ability. With such emphasis on movement, ranged attacks are a certain advantage, as units can be far away from opponents, offering possible immunity to counterattack. Abilities require the use of either S.P. or M.P., which both regenerate at a rate of ten per player phase, and vary in impact sizes (panels).
When all units belonging to a specific force are exhausted, having performed their restrictive one action per phase (which includes both movement and ability usage, from attacks to items), the game changes to the opposing player's phase, and back and forth until certain victory conditions have been met by one player, such as destroying all opposing units.

The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior trained by the high shaman who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people.
Having escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok, but his squire Tobar. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok.
Tak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea (or the ""Resurrection's Revenge"", as Jibolba refers to). Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength.
The Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted. Using his arsenal of Juju spells, Tak defeats Tlaloc and turns him into a sheep, finally fulfilling the prophecy.
","The gameplay mostly consists of platforming obstacles and puzzles.[clarification needed] The player has a health-meter represented by the feather on Tak's head. Tak's abilities are jumping, attacking, and a unique feature, the ability to interact with and get past obstacles with the help of animals.
When the player receives the Spirit Rattle, they gain access to the use of ""Juju Powers"" which are acquired by collecting tokens scattered around the environment. To restore Tak's health and mana the player must collect feathers, which are much more common in the environment than Juju Power tokens. The game heavily features collecting various other items. One of the game's developers said that the gameplay was based on Sly Cooper, the level design on the Jak and Daxter trilogy, and the humor of Ratchet and Clank[citation needed] which are all PlayStation exclusive franchises.

After Tak refuses, he is told that if he does not do this, he will be stuck in the dream forever. As he fights through the Dream World, he escapes through a Rift. When going through the rift, Tak wakes up, and Jibolba and Tak go find Jibolba's brother, JB. Lok wants to go, but Jibolba tells Lok to go fetch his magic sandals. Jibolba turns into a Flea for easy hauling, and they set off.
When Tak and Jibolba reach a dead end, they summon the Belly Juju to get a raft. Belly Juju uses a barrel that Tak got for him, and throws Tak in it, and throws the barrel down river. Lok is once again left behind, and when Belly Juju chokes, Lok has to save him. As Tak and Jibolba go down the fast current, they fall down a huge waterfall, and Tak is knocked out. He wakes up in the Dream World, once again being led by the Dream Juju. Once he makes it to the end, he again enters the real world through a rift. Once in the real world, Tak and Jibolba set off, again. When they reach a bridge, they have to wait for Woodies to pass, but when they do, Lok blows up the bridge, and the Woodies attack. When Tak saves Lok, he summons Mind-Reader Juju. He tells Tak that with three magic stones, he can make Bolas to get across the gap. When Tak does this, he is knocked out by Woodies, again entering the Dream World.
Tak then uses the Bolas to get through the Dream World. For the third time, he gets back to his world using a rift. When he awakes, he is in the holding area in the Gloomleaf Arena, where Woodies train, with Caged Juju. After an argument, Caged Juju finds Lok, and uses a lift key to get up. When up, Lok is hauled off by Woodies, and Tak fights through waves of Woodies. After four rounds, he uses a Woodie Catapult to escape, flying into the Gloomleaf Swamp. When half-way through the swamp, he sees Dead Juju being harassed by Woodies, who steal his Tiki. Tak follows the Woodies to the rafters of the Arena, where Tak steals the Tiki from the Woodie King. He is then chased down river by Woodies, and when he falls down a waterfall, he grabs to a ledge with Dead Juju. When he returns the Tiki, Lok suddenly falls down the waterfall, and the four head off together.
When outside Skyrock Crater, they can see JB's Planetarium. They all stop to smell the flowers, which make them all fall asleep. Tak uses a Woodie Catapult to cause destruction in the Dream World, finally making it to the Tower where the Dream Guardian is at. But, he goes through a rift, and is told that his next sleep will put him in the tower. He and Jibolba wake up, leaving Lok and Dead Juju. Tak and Jibolba go through the Crater, and make it to the Planetarium. But inside, the area is overrun by Power Parasites, and after a long fight, JB is saved. JB tells them that he has never heard of a Dream Juju. So, JB sends Tak into sleep. Tak then enters the tower, and has a long battle with the Dream Guardian. After the battle, Tak gets The Staff of Dreams. The princess appears, and is revealed to be Pins and Needles, and the Dream Juju reveals to be Tlaloc, still in Sheep form. Pins, Needles, and Tak all struggle for the Staff, and Needles gets one half, The Staff of Nightmares, and Tak gets the other, the Dream Shaker. This power causes all to enter the real world, and Pins, Needles, and Tlaloc escape. Tak then begins a chase of them, not watching where he is going, and gets knocked out.
When he wakes up, Tak is in the Moon Juju Interlude, and the Moon Juju was before him. She tells him to choose one of four Spirit Animals. Before she tells Tak the best one, she disappears. Tak chooses, which wakes him up, with new powers.
Tak meets the Giant Misunderstanding and needed help with the rift. The Giant thinks he wants to talk to Rick. Tak repeats the Rick question to the juju to unlock the rift. When he says goodbye, the Giant sings a song.
During the chase, Flora and Fauna grant Tak the ability to become 4 animals.
Tak is tired when he comes to the Dream Fortress. He battles Pins and Needles and gets the other half of the staff. Lok mistakenly gives the half to Tlaloc. Tak battles Tlaloc's army of sheep. After defeating all of the sheep, Tak attacks Tlaloc, knocking him over a ledge and killing him. Jibolba, Dead Juju, and Lok congratulate Tak on his victory and remind him they need to return the staff. Lok questions the appearance of an arm behind Tak which pulls him through a rift and back into the Dream Realm. The arm turns out to belong to Tlaloc who, after being killed in the real world, is now a nightmare creature and has his old body again. He uses the Staff of Nightmare to turn into a monster resembling the Dream Guardian. Tak does the same with his staff to fight Tlaloc. After the battle, the Dream Guardian appears asking for the staff back. Tak apologized to the Dream Guardian who opens a rift to return Tak to the real world. Back in the real world, Jibolba, Lok, and Dead Juju congratulate Tak again before Tlaloc appears again realizing he can never defeat Tak. He decides to instead kill his friends to  eliminate Tak's will to fight. Tak manages to save his friends and defeat Tlaloc a third time. Tak is then waken up by Jibolba and Lok telling him the whole thing was a dream. The three walk off while being spied on by a sheep from Tlaloc's army.
","The gameplay is almost identical to the first game, with differences being that Tak's weapon is always on hand, and that mana is represented by a feather count and not a meter. The game takes place in various locations, such as tropical forests, canyons, volcanic areas, snowy tundras and other harsh environments. There are also a number of dimensional stages, in the Dreamworld. Tak gets aid from animals, a number of which did not appear in the first game. In this game, Tak's juju magic is triggered by holding down one button and pressing combos of other buttons. Tak also earns juju powers gradually throughout the game instead of having to seek them out. Tak can also get certain animals to help him out in the real world.

Tak: The Great Juju Challenge,Yes (COOP),2005,Avalanche Software,THQ,"NA, PAL","The game begins with Jibolba summoning the player (just like the original game) into the Pig pen. He tells them that the Pupanunu Village is the host of The Great Juju Challenge, the first in 60 years. He then tells that Tak and Lok should be back by now. It then goes to Feathercrag, a location where Tak and Lok are looking for a Phoenix so they can get a feather to enter the challenge. After fighting Woodies and learning their powers, they finally catch up with the Phoenix, which is grabbed by two unknown men. However, Lok is able to grab a feather.
When they arrive to The Juju Realm for the challenges, the Moon Juju introduces the competitors. She introduces the four teams: Team Jibba Jabba, Team Grammazon, Team Pupanunu, and Team Black Mist (made up of two unknown men, Bartog and Crug). After they are dismissed, the Host Juju tells them what to do. After completing the first three challenges, the teams compete in a Proving Grounds match. After the match, Team Black Mist is eliminated. However, they return with the Two-Headed Juju who reveals that they messed up the scoring, and the Black Mist is back in.
Once again, they must go through three challenges, and then another Proving Grounds. Once again, Team Black Mist is eliminated. They once again return with Flora and Fauna who found Grammazon teeth in The Salt Lick of Performance Enhancement, so they are eliminated instead. Before the next match, Tak and Lok see Bartog and Crug talking to an unknown Juju, and planning. After three more challenges, the Proving Grounds match is played, but Team Jibba Jabba is eliminated. After the match Bartog and a different sounding Crug talk about burning down the Pupanunu Village, once they win. This means Tak and Lok must win.
On a return visit to The Gates of Nocturne, Tak and Lok find Crug, tied up. He reveals that they have been cheating with the Dark Juju, and the Juju and Bartog cut the weakest link, Crug. Crug knows a good way to do better than Team Black Mist. He tells them to go to Caster's Hill. Once there, Crug realizes that is not there. Next they go to Ambush Grove, where Tak and Lok find a collapsed Crug. He reveals that he defeated an invisible lizard to get The Ancient Hammer of Handy Juju, which he gives to Lok.
Finally, it comes down to two extremely hard challenges. After, Tak and Lok meet Bartog, ""Crug"", and the Moon Juju in the Proving Grounds. This is when the Dark Juju reveals himself, and announces his love for the Moon Juju. After three rounds, Tak and Lok win, and they keep the favor of the Moon Juju. When they return to the village, everyone is gone. But they have their own party, and end with a high-five.
","The gameplay is an obstacle course with a timer counting down.  Tak and Lok try to reach the exit with the least time possible.  The score depends on the time, items collected and enemies defeated. The game can either be played one player who switches between Tak and Lok or by playing two player with a friend each controlling a character on a split screen.

Tales of Phantasia,,"2003JP, 2006NA ,PAL",Wolf Team,"NamcoJPNintendoNA, PAL","NA, JP, PAL, AUS","The game begins as four heroes are locked in battle with a powerful sorcerer king named Dhaos. Before he can be defeated, Dhaos uses his magic to travel several years into the future, where he is immediately met by one of the four warriors' descendants and three companions, who seal him away with two magic pendants.[9] Twelve years later, two young men named Cress and Chester return to their village to find it razed to the ground by a dark knight named Mars, whose army kills many of its inhabitants including Cress's parents and Chester's sister. While Chester stays behind to bury them, Cress leaves to meet his uncle Olson for help, who reveals that he is being forced to work for Mars before stealing his father's pendant and locking him in jail.[10] Quickly escaping with the help of a dying woman in a nearby cell, he meets another prisoner, a young priestess named Mint, who reveals that the woman was her mother before the two leave through the dungeon's aqueducts.[11]
After rendezvousing with Chester, the party meets Trinicus D. Morrison, one of the four heroes who sealed Dhaos away years ago, who reveals that their parents were once his comrades and is shocked to discover that Cress and Mint's pendants were stolen.[12] Following him to a nearby mausoleum, the group encounters Mars just as he uses the pendants to break the seal on Dhaos's tomb, setting him free. As Mars is killed by the dark sorcerer after asking for his power, Trinicus laments that no force in this time can possibly stop Dhaos, and uses his magic to send Cress and Mint back through time to seek out a means to do so while Chester stays behind to cover their escape.[13] The two arrive one hundred years in the past to a time before Dhaos was initially sealed, where the villain is currently waging a war with his demon armies against the human kingdoms. Learning that only magic can harm him, they seek the aid of a young mage named Arche Klein, and summoner named Claus F. Lester, who accompany them to Dhaos's castle. After a fierce showdown, Dhaos escapes once again, and the party makes their way to an ancient city called Thor that houses a functional time machine to return to the future.[14]
Arriving just moments after they first left, Cress and his companions join Chester in his fight against Dhaos and seemingly defeat him for good. However, they are approached by a traveler named Harrisson from 50 years in the future who tells them that Dhaos is now ravaging the world in his time.[15] Using the Thor machine once again, the team arrives in the new period where they meet a ninja named Suzu who accompanies them (except in the original release). After meeting with a group of elves, Cress obtains the legendary Eternal Sword, the only thing that can stop Dhaos from moving through time, and travel to his invisible fortress for the final confrontation. After finally defeating him, the party learns from a tree spirit named Martel that he is a visitor from a dying planet called Derris-Kharlan, whose world was slowly withering due to the death of its world tree, the source of all mana and lifeblood of everything in it. Attempting to obtain a seed from this planet's world tree, Yggdrasil, Dhaos instead found that its power was fading as well due to the humans' constant misuse of mana-based technology, and decided to wipe them out to save it.[16] As the party members realize that by saving their world they have doomed his, Martel takes pity on their plight and sends a mana seed into space in an attempt to rejuvenate Derris-Kharlan's tree as Cress and his team return to their proper times.[17]
","In the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS), the fight is played out on a two-dimensional terrain that usually stretches wider than a single screen width, so the screen can scroll to the left and to the right, depending on where the characters and opponents are relatively located. LMBS contains a pause menu during battle which lets the player select a spell or item. As in some fighting games, it is possible to assign items or combination moves to specific buttons as shortcuts for quick actions.
As opposed to most other turn-based systems where the player controls the individual actions of every party member, in LMBS, the player only directly controls the main character in real-time. The other characters in the party can be set to passive mode (defend only), active mode and attack (computer-controlled), or the player can often force the characters to move or use a spell from the pause menu. For the titles that allow multiplayer, the other party characters can be controlled by other human players.

Tales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 3,,2005,Alfa System,Namco,JP,NaN,"Tales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 3 is a turn-based tactical RPG as well as a real-time RPG. Battles take place in enclosed areas that include ally parties and enemy units. Players move parties (consisting of three characters each) by selecting the sprite of the party's player-controlled character, then selecting the target location on the map. The limit of where the party can travel is indicated by dots between the target destination and the starting point of the party. When the dots are gray, the party can move to that location, as long as an obstacle does not block them. If it is red, then the target is out of range. The player can alter the destination of the party at any time during the player's turn. When the player ends the turn, all ally parties will move simultaneously. When one of the players' parties comes in contact with an enemy party, the player engages in a LMBS-style battle. In a typical RPG fashion, players level up their party members to gain stat increases. Like many Tales games, Narikiri Dungeon 3 includes the aspect of cooking: players can use acquired ingredients to prepare meals that affect party members, like replenishing HP, or temporarily gaining a certain stat in battle.

Tales of the World: Summoner's Lineage,,2003,Magical Company,Namco,JP,NaN,"Though structurally quite different from the usual Tales games, Summoner's Lineage features items and enemies that were seen in other titles. In this game, characters are moved across a grid-like board, only going into combat once they have moved themselves close enough to an enemy.  It is then that they will enter combat and be able to issue various commands such as physical attacks and magic spells in order to defeat their opponent. Each character and enemy is given an elemental alignment that determines which attacks will be best suited to defeating them (a ""fire"" character would take more damage from a water-based attack, for instance).
These differences in structure can be attributed to the fact that Summoner's Lineage is actually a gameplay sequel to a Japanese Namco Game Boy Color game called Pocket King,[1] a sequel to the 1988 Famicom title King of Kings (featured in Namco Anthology 2).
In addition to the principal characters of Tales of Phantasia, the player can also utilize Fulein's ability to summon several different kinds of creatures to aid in battle.  These monsters, like any other character, have their own unique statistics and attacks, as well as their own ways of approaching combat.

The Three Stooges,,2002,Cinemaware,Metro3D,,NaN,"John Cutter designed the game as a kind of board game.[2]
The Three Stooges must rescue an old woman's orphanage by earning money in minigames based on various Three Stooges films. These include cracker-eating contests (based on the Stooges short Dutiful But Dumb) and boxing matches (based on the short Punch Drunks).[3] Players select minigames by timing a button press as a hand randomly points to various symbols representing in-game events, including non-interactive events that can raise or lower the Stooges' cash total. Each event takes up one in-game day; players have 30 in-game days to earn as much money as possible.[4]
The hand gradually speeds up from one day to the next, but can be slowed down by landing on a space that allows Moe to pummel Larry and Curly. The player must avoid mousetrap spaces, which injure the fingers on the hand; landing on four such spaces immediately ends the game, regardless of the number of days completed.
Several different game endings are possible, depending on the amount of money the player has earned. These range from the banker foreclosing on the orphanage due to the Stooges' inability to collect enough money to pay the rent, to the orphanage being saved and renovated and the Stooges marrying the owner's three daughters.[4]
The game included a fair amount of humor â the game itself loads initially as Defender of the Crown (another Cinemaware title) with a splash screen and music. The game version of the Stooges walk onto the screen, the music screeches to a halt, a Larry soundbite exclaims ""Hey, this looks like a kid's game!"", Moe replies ""You idiots!"", and follows up with a smacking noise and Curly yelling, ""OH!"". The NES port, made by Activision, used a slightly edited version of the Ghostbusters title screen instead, in order to promote Ghostbusters II, and included an extra soundbite of Curly saying ""Hey, fellas! We're in the wrong game!"". The 2002 port by Crawfish Interactive kept the Defender of the Crown opening, only this time having Moe yell ""You idiots! We're in the wrong game!"", then having the Stooges walk along a country road with billboards advertising Crawfish, as well as the now-defunct Cinemaware and the then-upcoming game Wings.

He and his friend Fermat Hackenbacker, son of the Thunderbirdsâ engineer Brains, are extracted by Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, an IR agent, and her butler Aloysius Parker, using her limo FAB 1, as the Thunderbirds return from an oil rig fire off the Russian coast. Unbeknownst to them, a tracking beacon used by the Hood, a psychic criminal mastermind who has a vendetta against Jeff for not saving him in a collapsing diamond mine when his brother Kyrano was rescued, has been planted on the hull of Thunderbird 1.
The Hood's submarine locates Tracy Island and fires a missile at the orbiting Thunderbird 5, sending the Tracys in Thunderbird 3 to rescue John Tracy. The Hood and his minions Mullion and Transom take over the island's command center, imprisoning the Tracys in Thunderbird 5 as their oxygen runs out. The Hood reveals that he plans to use the Thunderbirds to rob the major banks of the world, which would plunge the world's monetary system into chaos and the IR organization will be blamed and disgraced for it. Alan, Fermat and their friend Tin-Tin, Kyrano's daughter, use a ventilation shaft to reach the Thunderbird silos.

Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring,No,2001,Cave Barn Studios,NewKidCo,"NA, PAL","Inside a haunted and creepy-looking mansion, Tom chases Jerry as usual while breaking everything in the process. Meanwhile, in the basement, Tom's owner, a wizard named Chip, attempts to make a magical potion using his magical ring until he realizes it does not work. Chip checks the milk carton that he used on the potion, but there is no substitution for the milk of a cow that lives in Calcutta. Later, Chip throws Tom into the basement and orders him to guard his magic ring while he goes to Calcutta to milk  the cow. If Tom does a good job, he'll be rewarded with a big juicy salmon but if not, ""there will one less kitty to clean up after around here"", meaning that Tom will be kicked out of the mansion for good. Chip then leaves for Calcutta using his motorcycle, leaving Tom in charge of guarding the ring in the basement. Unknown to Tom, an interested Jerry finds the ring while climbing the table and puts it on his head, wearing it like a crown. Jerry runs out of the mansion, and Tom frantically attempts to find him so he can get the ring back.
After losing Tom, Jerry attempts to get the ring removed by going to a jewelry store owned by a diamond cutter. However, the store is closed since the owner has left for lunch. Tom sneaks into the store and disguises himself as a worker using his tail for a mustache and attempting to help Jerry get the ring off, but to no avail. He reveals his true identity. Tom then destroys the store and ends up getting chased away by the enraged owner.
Afterwards, Jerry runs off into a fortunetelling home owned by Butch and Droopy. After seeing how lovely the ring looks and including the fact that Jerry wants it removed, Butch attempts to pull it off, but also fails.
Jerry then sees Physic Droopy. Tom comes in and Jerry runs out with Butch chasing after him as well. Soon, they end up in an alley where an alley cat happens to be taking a nap. He wakes up and tries to grab Jerry for his dinner. Tom successfully grabs Jerry in time and, by flicking the ring on his head, makes random objects fall on the horrified alley cat. Butch then comes and is able to get the ring off Jerry's head after Jerry bites Tom's hands, which causes him to be sent flying to the dog. Tom and the alley cat then chase Butch and then wind up spinning and roll toward Jerry, but the ring gets stuck back on Jerry's head. When Tom is running away from Butch and the alley cat, he takes a shortcut to lose sight of them until he accidentally slips on a banana peel, which Jerry's ring then increases the size of; Tom slips on it again and rides on it toward the door of a pet store, leaving Tom unconscious.
A kind old lady comes out and brings the two inside and the cage is filled with animals from all over the world and putting them in two separate cages. However, Tom is accidentally paired with Spike and his son Tyke while Jerry is left with two mice named Freddie and Joey, who bully a younger, cute and dimwitted mouse named Nibbles. At first, Jerry proves to be unsuccessful in trying to stop the mouse bullies from hurting Nibbles until he uses the ring to turn them into chunks of cheese. When the cheese mice escape the cage and Nibbles fails to catch up with them since he intends to eat them, Jerry uses the ring to make Nibbles grow into a giant mouse capable of breaking free from the cage as he grows and catch up with the cheese mice as they escape the store. An unnamed boy comes and buys Jerry as his pet to which he plays with Jerry until the ring produces magic, melting Tom. Escaping the cage, Tom sneaks outside and snatches Jerry from the boy's hand. The upset boy tells his mother, to which she tells a police officer who sends police cars after the duo. The alley cat and Butch alongside Spike and Tyke also find and chase Tom. Tom and Jerry escape by riding a bus driven by Droopy, but he stops and reverses the bus, causing Tom and Jerry to panic. The two become lost until the boy finds Tom and whistles, resulting in the duo ending up cornered in a garbage dump at a dead end. Jerry uses the magic ring to freeze the dogs, alley cat and police cars. Now safe, Tom and Jerry head back to the mansion where Tom once again tries to get the ring off, but fails in every attempt. Jerry hides in a kitchen cupboard and uses furniture ring remover to get the ring off before throwing the ring in the basement. Tom gets the ring, but to his horror it gets stuck firmly on his finger.
Hearing Chip coming, Tom tries to get the ring off, but to no avail. Tom attempts to trick Chip into thinking Tom has done a good job protecting his ring, but fails when Chip discovers the ring on Tom's finger. Thinking that Tom stole his ring, an angry Chip kicks Tom out of his mansion to which the ring immediately falls off Tom's finger. Following this, the ring unfreezes those who all chase Tom into the sunset. 
In the epilogue, Jerry receives the salmon from Chip to which he then turns it into cheese using the ring's power, and he enjoys the cheese as the film comes to an end.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear,Yes,2002,Ubisoft Milan,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the economic situation in Russia and the former Eastern Europe falls into chaos. Terrorism in the region is commonplace as people fight a seemingly endless stream of battles for supplies and other necessities. In this power vacuum though a dangerous a situation arises: the Russian mafia has begun buying up surplus military equipment with the assistance of current members of the Russian Army. During one such arms deal Rainbow forces raid the meeting grounds and recover weapons grade plutonium, tracing the missile material to an Arctic naval base. As it turns out, one boss in the Oil Mafia has been supplying arms and intel to various small-time terrorist groups whose international attacks Rainbow has had to deal with: A hostage situation at the Met in New York City, the attempted bombing of a tanker in the Sea of Japan, an airline hijacking in Brussels, and the neofascist takeover of a London TV station. But after the hijacking, an anonymous informant who has seen that this terror campaign has gone too far supplies information to Rainbow on who's behind the attacks and where his men will strike next.
A subsequent investigation reveals that the plutonium deals are part of a plan between a Russian organized crime boss named Maxim Kutkin and Azeri arms dealer Samed Vezirzade. These two men intend to use the plutonium purchased from the military to create suitcase sized nuclear weapons through the use of abandoned Russian military facilities, then distribute these weapons to terrorists on the black market. To prevent any instance of nuclear terrorism, Rainbow mobilizes against both parties, raiding the nuclear weapons production facility and intercepting two separate meetings between the mob and potential buyers with the aid of a dissident group of the Russian mob.
In the final two missions Rainbow zeros in Vezirzade's base of operations, raiding his fortress and killing him after an attempt to bring him in alive fails. In the aftermath of Vezirzade's death, Kutkin realizes that the overall plan to manufacture and sell nuclear weapons has failed, and seeks vengeance for the collapse of the arms deals. With the assistance of a small number of men loyal to him, Kutkin seizes control of a commercial nuclear power plant and threatens to shut off the cooling system for the reactors, which would result in a nuclear meltdown. To prevent a potential repeat of the Chernobyl disaster, Rainbow forces storm the plant and manage to recapture the facility intact.
In the final debriefing, Kutkin is confirmed to have been killed in the raid. His mansion in Russia is acquired by the ""Russian Godfather"", whose assistance had been vital during Rainbow's operations (it turns out he was the anonymous informant, and Kutkin was his own insane son-in-law). After arriving at the mansion, the Russian Godfather makes a short speech which is picked up by surveillance bugs planted during an earlier Rainbow intelligence operation. The godfather then shoots the bug, preventing any further monitoring of the mafia from the mansion.

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow,No,2004,Ubisoft,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL","In March 2006, the United States has established a military presence in the newly-independent country of East Timor to train the East Timorese military in their fight against anti-separatist Indonesian guerrilla militias. Foremost among these militias is the Darah dan Doa (English: Blood and Prayer), led by the charismatic Suhadi Sadono.
Sadono, once trained by the CIA to help fight communism in the region, has grown resentful of U.S. support of East Timor and its supposed interference with Indonesian sovereignty. Sadono orchestrates a suicide bombing and follow-up attack on the U.S. embassy in Dili, capturing a number of U.S. military and diplomatic personnel including Douglas Shetland, an old friend and comrade of Sam Fisher.
Meanwhile, Fisher is sent to infiltrate the embassy and gather intelligence on the Darah Dan Doa. Fisher succeeds in his mission, and the embassy is retaken by the U.S. Army's Delta Force. Sadono escapes, and the United States launches a military campaign in Indonesian territory in an attempt to hunt him down, much to the protests of the Indonesian government who is seeking to protect Sadono.
Fisher learns that Sadono has masterminded a scheme known as ""Pandora Tomorrow"", by placing a series of ND133 biological bombs, equipped with the smallpox virus, on U.S. soil. Every 24 hours, Sadono makes encrypted phone calls to each of the bomb carriers to delay the release of the virus. If he is killed or detained, the virus is released and millions of Americans will die. Because Sadono is fighting on the front lines in the conflict, the U.S. cannot risk killing him outright, and is forced to withdraw its forces.
To prevent Sadono from taking advantage of the situation, Fisher is sent to infiltrate Darah Dan Doa strongholds in order to learn the location of the smallpox bombs so Sadono can be captured. He is assisted in this endeavor by Shetland and his private military company, Displace International. Fisher learns the location of the bombs, and Shadownet spies are sent in to neutralize them. After the bombs are disarmed, NSA's Third Echelon decides to capture Sadono alive instead of assassinating him, due to the problems created when Fisher assassinated former Georgian president Kombayn Nikoladze in late 2004.
Although Fisher manages to capture Sadono, Third Echelon learns that a rogue CIA operative Sam met earlier on board a train, Norman Soth, has acquired the last smallpox-armed ND133, and intends to detonate it inside Los Angeles International Airport. Soth is motivated not by Indonesia, but by a perceived betrayal which resulted in the loss of a leg years prior, and intends to exact revenge on the United States. Fisher infiltrates the airport, kills Soth and his group of terrorists (disguised as airport workers and security guards), and prevents the detonation of the last smallpox-armed ND133 by disguising himself as a maintenance worker and setting the ND133 down behind two policemen, who notice the device almost immediately, and subsequently have the airport evacuated. The Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad is then called in to perform a controlled explosion of the device, which is done by an automated vehicle armored with reinforced steel.
","The gameplay of Pandora Tomorrow is largely unchanged from the original Splinter Cell. The game features some moderate graphical improvements, as well as minor gameplay changes such as the fact that health kits are no longer an inventory item, and the addition of a laser sight to Sam's pistol that allows the player to know exactly where the rounds will strike, even when moving around. Also, Sam can now open doors while carrying a body, shoot while hanging upside down, a ""SWAT turn"" past doorways unnoticed (move from one side of the door to other while covered), and perform a half split jump. The SWAT turn was removed and the pistol laser was replaced with an OCP (Optically Channeled Potentiator) which can temporarily disable electronic devices in Chaos Theory, the next entry in the series. The PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions also feature an additional single player mission to compensate for the abridged gameplay compared to the PC and Xbox versions.

Tomato Adventure,,2002,Graphic Research,Nintendo,JP,"The story takes place in a land ruled by young characters,[clarification needed] the Ketchup Kingdom, which is also filled with devices like Jack-in-the-Boxes.  The protagonist is a hare-like boy in blue clothing name DeMille, who lives in a school bus with no wheels in a village on the outskirts of the Ketchup Kingdom called Cobore Village.  DeMille is an outcast because he dislikes tomatoes. As a result, he and other kids in Kobora who dislike tomatoes are looked down upon as ""Droppers"", banished for heresy, and locked up in Cobore Village until they change their attitudes towards tomatoes. While watching television, DeMille sees that the main antagonist, King AbÄ«ra, is celebrating a holiday called Tomato Day, while showing his project he created called the Super Cara-Cooker, a laser-like gun that transforms people, places, and things into dolls, toys, and playgrounds. After DeMille's television set gets severely damaged, he visits his neighbor and friend Seremo and asks him if he could fix his television set.  Seremo says he will and gives DeMille his first Gimmick, called the Gear Yo-Yo.
After Seremo teaches DeMille how to use it, DeMille's girlfriend Patharan comes to tell him that she wanted him and her to venture into the dangerous Toy Ruins to look for her Fantastic Toy, the Gimmick Robo, but by the time they arrive, it is absent. Then, two purple creatures with zippers on them, Brikky and Grikky, capture Patharan with a hook. DeMille grabs on to her while being pulled up to the airship, the Carorna No.2, piloted by Brikky and Grikky. As soon as DeMille and Patharan come aboard the airship, Brikky and Grikky receive a call from King AbÄ«ra to bring Patharan to the palace and drop DeMille out of the airship. After DeMille fights Brikky and Grikky, they drop DeMille from the airship into the Tomato Pond, only for him to notice that he is standing near King AbÄ«ra's home, the Gimmick Palace, a tall, red, tower with a tomato-shaped top. When he decides to enter and save Patharan, he encounters a wall that he cannot pass through. Then, a mole named Rereku tells him that in order to pass through the wall, DeMille has to defeat the six Super Kids and obtain the six key items called Toy Parts. While DeMille goes on his adventure, he befriends some people for them to join forces with him to defeat King Abira and save Patharan and the entire Ketchup Kingdom. His partners in order of joining him are Arisa, Sofubi, and Rereku.
","Players control DeMille through the Ketchup Kingdom while talking to people, entering places and collecting items. The object of the game is to save DeMille's girlfriend, Patharan, and the Ketchup Kingdom from King Abira by going through every village to obtain the missing parts of a robot that can give anyone access into the Gimmick Palace, a tower-like structure with a tomato on it. Instead of wandering endlessly inside places or entering battles randomly, Tomato Adventure displays enemies moving around on the screen while entering battles by bumping DeMille into them.

Tomb Raider: Legend,No,2006,Core Design,Eidos Interactive,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Tomb Raider: Legend is a single-player action-adventure game in which the player controls Lara Croft, from a third-person perspective, through eight levels set across seven locations around the world.[6][7][8] As Lara Croft, the player can jump, climb and shimmy along ledges and vertical poles or ladders, crawl through small spaces, swing on ropes and horizontal poles, interact with objects and switches, use a grappling line to swing across gaps and pull objects towards her, and swim and dive underwater for a limited time. Different button combinations can create more moves such as a roll and swan dive.[8][9]:10â11 Some levels have Lara on a motorbike racing through that part of the level while fighting enemies.[8][10]
Puzzles can block progress in the level until Lara solves them by activating switches within the area. These and other objectives such as avoiding or jamming traps can involve pushing large blocks around the environment.[7] In some sections, the player must pass quick time events by reacting to control prompts that appear on screen.[7] While exploring, Lara can use her grapple to move and destroy certain objects, use a small torch to illuminate dark areas, identify different environmental characteristics using her binoculars, and pick up a maximum of three Health Packs which can heal damage suffered during gameplay.[9]:14â15 Collectable Artefacts hidden in each level can be found and unlock extra features, while Time Trials challenge players to complete any level within a time limit.[7][9]:14â15
During combat, Lara automatically locks on to enemies, with the player able to switch to another target within range. She can move around freely to avoid enemy attacks and trigger environmental hazards to aid her in combat. Lara can access up to two weapon types; her default twin pistols with infinite ammunition, and a secondary weapon, which is picked up during a level and has limited ammunition which can be replenished from defeated enemies carrying the same weapon type. Lara can also carry grenades to throw at enemies, perform melee attacks when she is close enough, and use her grapple to briefly stun them. When close to a targeted enemy, Lara can perform a jump attack which slows down time while she is airborne, allowing her more time to dispatch her enemies.[7][8][9]:12â13 If Lara's health is depleted she dies and restarts at a previous checkpoint.[11]
The home console, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation Portable (PSP) versions share content and level design.[12][13] The PSP version includes exclusive ""Tomb Trials"". These missions have players either navigating a series of obstacles within a time limit or hunting treasures within one of the game's levels. Tomb Trials can be completed both in single-playing and multiplayer mode, where two players can compete in one on a local network.[13][14] The Nintendo DS (DS) version uses a hybrid of 3D environments and 2D sprites. Lara moves through levels as in the main versions and players use the DS's touchscreen and mike functions in gameplay. The Game Boy Advance (GBA) version is a 2D side-scroller.[6] The mobile version uses three of the locations and splits its gameplay into two types per location. In platforming sections players must guide Lara through environmental hazards. In combat sections Lara must dodge enemy fire and kill all enemies to move forward. The gameplay in each stage plays out on rails with limited movement and input from the player.[15]

Tomb Raider: The Prophecy,No,"2002NA , PAL",Core Design,Eidos Interactive,"NA, PAL, JP","The game is based around an ancient prophecy written in the Tome of Ezekiel, which tells of three magical stones, used by various powerful rulers around the world. Lara Croft must find these stones before a cult known as the Teg-du-Bhorez can collect them all and use them to revive a mystical being known as the Great Grey One, thus bringing about the end of the world. Throughout the game Lara searches for the stones and thinks that she has found them. However, she realises that she was mistaken and has to come back to defeat the game's villain.
","Unlike previous handhelds in the series such as the Tomb Raider: Curse of the Sword, which played in a side-scrolling two-dimensional form, reminiscent of 8-bit games, The Prophecy instead plays in an isometric viewpoint, giving the player a viewpoint from above the player character's head.[1] The game contains many familiar elements of the franchise such as being able to jump, run, climb and shoot. As the game was the first Tomb Raider to be rendered in an isometric view until Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, the game was also given a new combat system to suit the view style. The system does not include the regular player-controlled lock on gun play of previous games. It does instead contain an auto-lock system to make combating enemies easier. There are three weapons that the player can use: Lara's signature handguns, Uzi pistols and golden guns. The controls were designed to be simple, with the directional pad assigned to movement, the A button is used as a jump button, the R button pulls out or holsters weapons, and the L button allows the player to sprint.

After dominating a local competition, they are approached by Tony Hawk, who offers to take them to L.A. so they can immerse themselves in the 'West Coast style' of skateboarding. Upon arriving, they run into Mindy, a local skate enthusiast and aspiring comic artist who dreams of publishing her own comic called American Sk8teland, named after a famous skatepark Tony used to frequent. Upon seeing how dilapidated the place has become, the group decide to renovate the place and restore it to its former glory.
As the renovations progress and other pro skaters lend their support, Mindy informs the group that a publishing office in East L.A. wants to distribute her work, provided she supply them with a comic detailing American Sk8teland's return to prominence. However, Tony reveals that the park's owner has accepted an offer to sell the place, and they have two weeks to match the offer before it's torn down. After helping Rodney Mullen pull off a successful flatland demo, Mindy, upon noticing people were filming the demo, realizes they can make a similar video with the pros who helped make the park famous. Once the repairs are finished, the group films the pros doing various tricks and stunts around the park, culminating in Tony convincing the new skateboarder to pull off a Japan 900 to close out the demo. The video is a huge success when released, giving Tony the money needed to purchase American Sk8teland and Mindy the material needed to start her comic.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2|SK8: Tony Hawk no Pro Skater 2JP,,2001,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 puts the player in control of a professional or fictional skater and takes place in a third-person view with a fixed camera. The player must perform tricks and complete level objectives in return for cash rewards, which can be used to unlock other levels, improve the player character's statistics and obtain better equipment.[3] The game's universe maintains a loose grip on physics for the sake of gameplay quality; while the player character can jump reasonable heights and perform short slides early on in their career, they may eventually come to slide for much longer distances and reach such a disproportionate height in their jumps as to be capable of stringing an unrealistic chain of maneuvers together midair.[4] The player can move freely throughout the levels without constraint and fulfill the different objectives in any order desired.[5]
In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, the player character is self-propelling and can have their course altered via the arrow keys or d-pad. The player character is capable of jumping and change direction midair. The game features a vast number of skateboarding tricks.[6] One button can be used to switch footedness between ""regular"" or ""goofy"", while another can initiate a nollie or a fakie. Passing from a nollie to a fakie (or vice versa) in a chain of tricks increases the multiplier factor of the score collected for that chain. Other button inputs can be used to perform slides, grabs, and flips. A series of inputs can be used to perform lip tricks. It is possible to perform wall rides and transfers (changing ramps) as well as manuals that allow several tricks to be chained together.[5] The player must use directional input to maintain balance during a manual; in the 2X port, balance is visually represented by a vertical scale that appears next to the player character.[7]
The game features ten professional skateboarders, along with four unlockable original characters, depending on the version.[8] Furthermore, the game features Spider-Man via a licensing deal with Marvel Comics.[9] Additionally, the South Korean and other Asian versions featured the girl group Fin.K.L..
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 features five modes of gameplay: Career Mode, Free Skate, Single Session, Multiplayer and the Level Editor. The Career Mode is played as a series of levels of increasing difficulty. Each level has ten objectives to perform within a period of two minutes. Some objectives are found in all levels, such as accumulating a particular score, collecting letters of the word ""SKATE"" scattered throughout the level or seeking and obtaining a hidden videotape. Other objectives are more varied, such as making figures at specific locations, jumping to difficult places or collecting particular objects. Each completed objective is rewarded with cash, which can be used to improve skater statistics and obtain new equipment and playable characters. A select few levels take place in a competition in which the player must perform for judges and accumulate the highest score within three one-minute rounds. The jury bases its score on the variety, difficulty and quality of the performed tricks. To fully complete these levels, the player must both accumulate a score high enough to win a gold medal and collect all the cash scattered within the level. The mode includes a series of small bonuses given for transfers, jumps and slides made across particular environmental elements. A list of these bonuses, referred to as ""gaps"", are compiled in a checklist that is viewable from the game's option menu. Other single-player modes include the Single Session, in which the player can freely accumulate a high score within two minutes using any previously-obtained levels and characters, and the Free Skate, in which there is no time limit imposed.[7][10][11]
The multiplayer mode consists of five types of games: ""Graffiti"", ""Trick Attack"", ""Tag"", ""HORSE"" and ""Free Skate"".[3][10][12] In ""Graffiti"", players must accumulate the highest score by changing level elements into their own color via the use of tricks. If a player performs a higher-scoring trick on an element that has already been marked, the element will change to that player's color. ""Trick Attack"" is a mode in which players must accumulate the highest score by chaining tricks together. ""Tag"" is an interpretation of the traditional game of tag that gives each player a timer, which only counts down when they've been touched by the other player and are therefore ""it"". The player who is ""it"" can decrease the speed of the other player and increase the ease in tagging them by performing tricks. The player who causes the other player's timer to run out is the winner. ""HORSE"" is a game that is played intermittently between two players, who must compete in rounds lasting either eight seconds or until a trick has been made. The player with the lower score on any given turn receives a letter in the word ""HORSE"" or whatever word the players had generated prior to the game's start. The first player to accumulate the entire word loses.[11][12][13][14][15] ""Free Skate"" allows the players to skate freely on the same level without any given goal.[7]
The game's Level Editor incorporates over 100 pieces and a variety of pre-built park bases.[6] The construction of a level is initiated on a flat and empty canvas that can be rotated at any angle. The setting can be altered between themes such as a warehouse or park, and elemental pieces are rotatable and flexible in size.[16][17]
The game featured a total of thirteen real-life professional skateboarders, along with four unlockable original characters, depending on the version.[18][19] Furthermore, the game features Spider-Man via a licensing deal with Marvel Comics.[20] Additionally, the South Korean and other Asian versions featured the girl group Fin.K.L..

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3,Yes,2002,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 saw the introduction of the revert, a trick that enabled vert combos to be tied together with a manual, by tapping a button when landing in a quarterpipe; it allows for much longer combos than in the previous two games, where landing in a quarterpipe would finish a combo. It also added hidden combos. These were variations on standard tricks that could be performed as grab, flip, lip, or grind tricks. For example, double-tapping the kickflip button would make the character perform a double kickflip. This system would later be refined in Pro Skater 4.
The game stood out in the franchise for being the first title to have online capabilities. Users could connect directly to other players online on the PlayStation 2 versionâeven prior to the launch of the network adapter, with a USB Ethernet adapter. Due to the shut down of most Sony servers the game is no longer playable with others online, except for via programs like XLink Kai or through websites that allow users to play online through a DNS. The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions run on the Pro Skater 2 engine, with a different revert animation that is the same as the PlayStation version of Pro Skater 4.
The game features thirteen professional skateboarders, along with several unlockable original characters, depending on the version.[4] Furthermore, the game features Darth Maul, Doom Guy and Wolverine via licensing deals,[5] as well as extreme sports athletes Shaun Palmer and Kelly Slater. Additionally, the Japanese and other Asian versions featured the three Japanese pro skaters.
In both the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation versions, the wooden sides on the board (around the grip tape) has colors (except Bam Margera, Jamie Thomas, and the custom skater's decks), and the game has new tricks such as the Cannonball, Wrap Around, Fingerflip, Del Mar Indy and a new animation for the Airwalk. The Xbox version has an improved frame rate over the PlayStation 2 and GameCube version, including an additional level, the Oil Rig.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4,,2002,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Pro Skater 4 is a departure from the previous three games' Career mode, in which the player had a set amount of time in order to find and complete goals. 4 instead featured a Career mode more similar to Free Skate mode, in which there was no time limit to explore the level, the goals are usually offered to the player to attempt by characters found in the level. This Career mode would be later seen as the Story modes of the Underground series, American Wasteland, Project 8 and Proving Ground.
The game builds on the success of the gameplay in the previous games in the series. All of the combos from the previous game make an appearance, as well as some new tricks that can be performed to better navigate parks and areas. New to the game is the spine transfer, in which the player can press the shoulder button to transfer between quarter-pipes connected back-to-back, or otherwise self-right themselves to exit quarter-pipes or prevent bailing should they fly off them. The game also features skitching, which lets skaters hang off the back of moving vehicles.
The ""hidden combos"" for turning some tricks into slight variations in Pro Skater 3 turned into a standard feature, albeit not as advanced as the system would turn out in the next game in the series, where it was finalized. Also included was the ability to do grind and lip extensions by tapping a direction and grind while grinding or lipping, which can also grant the player bigger combos as they can do a grind extension into a special move, for example. As with trick extensions, this would be standard in the next game in the series where it was much simpler to do. The game is also the only one in the series where the player does not have to buy tricks. Instead, the basic trick-set the player gets is allocated depending on what type of move set the player defines for their character.
The game features fifteen professional skateboarders. Additionally, the player can unlock four other playable characters; Jango Fett from Star Wars, Eddie, the ubiquitous mascot of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden, Mike Vallely, who is a professional skater and wrestler, and Daisy, a female skater visually based on and voiced by Jenna Jameson.[4]
With broadband, a room of up to eight people can be hosted. With dial-up, a room up to three people can be hosted. Players with either connection can join any room.

Tony Hawk's Underground,,2003,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL","The protagonist and their friend, Eric Sparrow, live in suburban New Jersey and dream of becoming famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater Chad Muska, visiting town for a demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that a good way to start a skating career is to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees until he sees something to set them apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan, New York with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire as vengeance for stealing from the skate shop.
There, the pair shoot a skating video that impresses Stacy, who loans them a van and suggests they enter the Tampa AM, an amateur division skate contest held annually at the Skate Park of Tampa in Florida. Upon arrival, Eric is arrested for insulting a police officer, and the protagonist does favors for the local police department to secure his bail. However, when they arrive for the contest, it is revealed that Eric had only completed his own application form and not the protagonist's, forcing a dejected protagonist to try and impress competitors in the pro contest in order to gain admission. After impressing Tony Hawk, the protagonist wins the Best Trick event at Tampa AM and is offered deals by major skateboard sponsors, much to Eric's dismay. The protagonist then heads to San Diego, California to meet Todd, the manager of the team, and completes several photo shoots for a magazine. Following a wild celebration party, it is revealed that Eric has been picked up by the same sponsor.
The team then flies out to Hawaii to film a video, with the protagonist aiming for local spots that skaters have not filmed at before. Finding a tall hotel, the protagonist climbs to the roof and recruits Eric to film a trick video atop it. The police arrive to arrest them for trespassing, but the protagonist uses the opportunity to perform a McTwist over the helicopter and onto the awning of the adjacent Royal Hawaiian Hotel, allowing them and an awestruck Eric to evade the police. The team then travels to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After doing errands for locals and finishing their part of the team video, the protagonist attends the video premiere at the Slam City Jam. Eric steals the idea and edits the protagonist's part out of the video, allowing only Eric to become a professional. After angrily confronting Eric, the protagonist enters Eric's pro contest and wins, becoming a pro as well.
After designing their own pro skateboard, the protagonist and Eric embark on a team trip to Moscow, Russia, where they reconcile. Eric gets drunk and joyrides in a Russian military tank. The protagonist hops in and attempts to stop the tank, but being unfamiliar with the controls, fails to stop it from crashing. Eric jumps out and runs away, leaving the protagonist, trapped inside, to be arrested by the Russian military. Eric then lies and claims the protagonist stole the tank, stating that he in fact tried to stop them. Unwilling to pay the $700,000 worth of damages, Todd kicks the protagonist off the team, much to Eric's delight. The American Embassy bails out the protagonist, leaving them to do favors for locals in order to return home to New Jersey.
Eric, who now owns his own skate company, reveals that he had been planning to betray the protagonist after having long abandoned the idea of ""soul skating"" (skating for enjoyment rather than riches); after unsuccessfully trying to exempt them from the Tampa AM, Eric stole the helicopter footage in jealousy before finally getting the protagonist kicked off the skate team by lying back in Moscow. Determined to fight back, the protagonist teams up with Peralta and several professionals to create a soul skating video, creating a new trick in the process. Due to the success of the video, Eric challenges the protagonist to one last skate-off, with the unedited helicopter tape at stake. The protagonist wins the skate-off and walks away with the tape whilst Eric breaks down and sulks in anger.
If the story has been completed more than once, an alternate ending occurs, where the protagonist knocks Eric unconscious, taking the tape back instead of holding the skate-off.
","Like its predecessors in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground is centered on skateboarding in a series of levels.[2] The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.[3]
While a grind, lip, or manual trick is underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player prevents this meter from falling to the left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo.[3] Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip.[4] Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.[2]
The levels are based on regions of the United States and other countries.[2] In each level, certain tasks that advance the game's narrative must be completed before the player can move on. These tasks include score attacks, races, item collection, and reaching one of many gaps[b] found in a level.[4] Each level houses one professional skateboarder, who provides a sidequest that unlocks a trick for the Special Meter.[6] On account of the levels' large sizes and the integration of goals into the story, Underground has been described as an adventure game.[7][8] Characters can level up their statsâwhich include jump height and speedâby completing optional goals in a level;[4] this adds an element of role-playing gameplay.[7][8] Other gameplay modes include multiplayer minigamesâone, a combat mode called ""Firefight"", can be played online in the PlayStation 2 version of the gameâand a ""free skate"" mode that lets the player explore levels with no goals or story.[2]
Underground features extensive customization. The player creates a custom character for the story mode, and may not play as a pre-made professional skater outside a few contexts: a special scene late in the game, minigames, and the free skate mode. A level editor allows the player to create skate parks with a large array of objects,[2] ranging from traditional skate park elements like halfpipes, ramps, funboxes, and grind rails to more outlandish pieces like buildings and sections of elevated freeways.[9] The player can change their park's time of day and environmental theme. Tricks, skateboards, and level goals may be customized as well.[2]
The game features many real world professional skateboarders including: Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Paul Rodriguez, Chad Muska, Mike Vallely, and Stacy Peralta. Underground also features cameo appearances by Iron Man, a parody of C.H.U.D. called T.H.U.D., and Kiss bassist Gene Simmons.
While the console versions of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional Tony Hawk's game, with little attention given to the story or customization.[10] The mobile version is similarly restricted.[11]
"
Tony Hawk's Underground 2,,2004,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL","The protagonist is skating in their hometown, a neighborhood in New Jersey, when a van shows up in the middle of the ramp and the protagonist slams into it, knocking them out. Two people wearing hockey masks kidnap the protagonist and take them to a dark room with pro skaters Bob Burnquist, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Mike Vallely and Chad Muska as well as Eric Sparrow (the protagonist's rival in Tony Hawk's Underground). The kidnappers, revealed to be Tony Hawk and Bam Margera, explain their plans for their debut ""World Destruction Tour"", a worldwide, publicity-free skateboarding tour where two teams (Team Hawk and Team Bam) compete for points, and the losing team has to pay for all the expenses. The player joins Team Hawk while Bam chooses Paulie ""Wheels of Fury"" Ryan, a foul-mouthed kid who wears a body cast and drives a high powered wheelchair.
In Boston, the first leg of the tour, Team Bam manages to win at the last minute, thanks to one of Paulie's stunts. As a result, Bob Burnquist (a member of Team Hawk) is eliminated, via having a tennis ball shot at his genitals. Later on, in Barcelona, Team Hawk manages to take the lead again, however, the punishment for Team Bam is to having the player swap teams (in this case, Sparrow moves from Bam's team to Tony's team and the player doing the opposite, much to Bam's relief and Tony's annoyance.) At that time though, word had spread out about the World Destruction Tour, which was supposed to be a low-profile event but now is appearing on TV news because of a video of Bam and  Koston letting a bull trash Bam's father and team Bam captain Phil's hotel room.
In Berlin, the player and Sparrow are swapped back. At that moment, an underground film ""writer, producer, director"" by the name of Nigel Beaverhausen wishes to bring the tour to the public but instead winds up being humiliated by Tony and Bam. After causing chaos in Bangkok (the skaters were en route to Australia, though Muska suggested stopping in Thailand), the Tour lands in Australia. At the end of the leg, the player is supposed to be eliminated by being stripped down to their underwear and hit by mousetraps launched at them, but due to Mullen spotting a mathematical error in team Hawk's points, the player has to compete with Sparrow - the loser will be eliminated from the tour.
The group ponders what to do when a skater kid arrives and shows them a video of the tour, created by Beaverhausen. Tony decides that whoever humiliates Beaverhausen will stay on the tour. Sparrow manages to steal his clothes but the player, with Nigel's clothes, goes off causing a rampage on Australian citizens so that Beaverhausen will be blamed for it. Eric is eliminated as a result, in which the tour goes to New Orleans.
At the end of the New Orleans leg, Nigel reveals that he filmed the whole tour, even before he met Tony and Bam in Berlin. Nigel proposes that if he is allowed to film the whole tour, he will pay for all the damages of the tour. After Phil shows Tony and Bam the long damage bill, they accept. Team Hawk performs a death-defying stunt called the ""Equalizer"" to tie up with Team Bam and is successful, but team members Vallely, Muska, and Mullen are arrested by the cops for stealing the helicopter used for the stunt, leaving the player and Hawk for the final leg of the Tour: Skatopia, defined by Tony as ""the skateboarding Mecca"". 
Team Hawk, though reduced to two members, performs well enough to win, Bam decides to blow up Skatopia, confident on his victory. In order to save people from the imminent damage, Tony evacuates the skaters. Bam dares the player, who is still stuck in the back end of Skatopia, to exit the whole flaming park in a combo, which he considers impossible. The player takes the dare and gives Team Hawk the win for the World Destruction Tour. Nigel wants Bam to give him the tape of the tour, which shows Phil in the toilet, shouting to his wife April for more toilet paper. The game ends with Bam and Tony humiliating Beaverhausen once more, as Bam pulls down his pants on international TV.
","The gameplay in Underground 2 is similar to that of previous Tony Hawk games: the player skates around in a 3D environment modeled after various cities and attempts to complete various goals. Most goals involve skating on or over various objects or performing combos. Scores are calculated by adding the sum of the point value of each trick strung together in a combo and then multiplying by the number of tricks in the combo. New gameplay features include the Focus ability, which the player may trigger with a full Special gauge to cause time to slow down in order to help keep up their combo (by allowing greater control of their grind balance, for example); the Natas Spin, which can be performed on small surfaces like pillars or fire hydrants; and the Freak Out, which serves as another combo starter by having the player fill a gauge after certain bails, which will result in them angrily disposing of their board before continuing their session. In addition, the Wallplant maneuver was repurposed as the Sticker Slap.
Many levels return from previous games, including an expanded Warehouse (which also serves as the Story Mode's training area), School and Downhill Jam from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Canada, Los Angeles and Airport from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, and Philadelphia from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.
A classic mode was added to Underground 2, which allows players to skate through both new and remade classic levels in the traditional 10-goal, two-minute time limit mode that was present in Pro Skater, Pro Skater 2 and Pro Skater 3, complete with the stat points scattered all around the levels. In classic mode, the player chooses from one or two levels in which to attempt to complete enough goals to advance. All of the ""remade"" levels are accessible only through ""Classic Mode"" although once unlocked, it is possible to play them in any mode except Story.

Tron 2.0: Killer App,,2004,Digital Eclipse,Buena Vista Games,"NA, PAL","The plot of Tron 2.0 centers around Alan's son Jethro ""Jet"" Bradley. Since the events of Tron, ENCOM has been taken over by a company called FCon (Future Control Industries). During a phone conversation between Jet and his father, Alan is kidnapped. Ma3a, an artificial intelligence designed by Alan, digitizes Jet into Alan's computer. She informs Jet that she needs him to aid her against J.D. Thorne, an executive from FCon who attempted to digitize himself into the computer as well, but became corrupted during the process and turned into a virus spreading throughout the system.
Upon arriving, Jet is captured by Kernel, the system's security program, and is accused of being the source of the corruption. However, Kernel spares Jet on the recommendation of Mercury, a program also tasked to help Ma3a, and sends Jet to the light cycle arena. After winning several matches, Jet escapes the arena with Mercury's help. After the two reunite with Ma3a, the server is reformatted due to its rampant corruption, which results in Mercury's demise. Jet escapes to the original ENCOM grid with Ma3a and accesses an archive with the help of an antiquated program, I-No, to retrieve the source code for ""Tron Legacy"", an update to the original TRON that Alan wrote to protect Ma3a. Jet and Ma3a then access the Internet and find a compiler, which they use to begin compiling the Tron Legacy source code. During the process, Thorne attacks them and appears to kill Ma3a, while Jet receives a communication from Guest, the User who had assigned Mercury to help him. Accessing a video uplink, Jet sees his father trapped inside a storage closet, who holds up a sign telling him to not compile the Legacy program. However, the compile finishes before Jet can abort it, and Legacy activates, revealing that its sole function is to kill all rogue Users in the digital world. Jet escapes in a light cycle, and FCon inadvertently saves him by capturing Ma3a with a Seeker search program.
Having recovered the correction algorithms necessary to digitize a human, Alan is sent to Thorne's corrupted server and assists Kernel and his ICPs (Intrusion Countermeasure Programs). Meanwhile, Jet finds Thorne at the heart of the server and confronts Kernel in a duel that ends in Kernel's destruction before he can kill Thorne. Thorne, in a moment of lucidity, begs Jet for forgiveness and tells him how to enter FCon's server before he dissipates.
Alan and Jet break into FCon's server, which the corporation is planning to use to distribute Datawraiths - digitized human hackers - across the worldwide information network for purposes of corporate and international espionage. After Alan and Jet crash the server, the CEO of FCon (which the game implies could be Ed Dillinger, the ENCOM senior executive from the original film) orders Baza, Popoff, and Crowne into the system themselves. Alan, wanting to verify the purity of the correction algorithms, removes them from Ma3a to inspect them. As a result, when the three FCon employees are digitized, they become a monstrous amalgam that chases Jet into the digitizing beam. Jet battles the monster amalgam and ejects the employees out of the beam, releasing their code from the corruption one by one. Severing the CEO's control, Alan and Jet extract and save the Tron Legacy code as the ENCOM servers crash. The game ends with Alan planning to reassemble the digitized FCon team and bring them back to the real world.
","The single-player campaign takes place entirely inside the computer's world, though some cutscenes take place inside the ENCOM research laboratory. Levels are entirely linear, providing no choices to the player of how to proceed or what to say when interacting with other characters. The goal of each level is generally to complete tasks and find keys (""permission bits"") that allow access to the next level.
Jet begins with a disc weapon similar to the ones featured prominently in the movie, but obtains additional weapons throughout the game that resemble real-life weapons like a shotgun, a submachine gun, a sniper rifle, and hand grenades. Each weapon aside from the disc uses energy as ammunition, which Jet can collect at various points in the game.
Jet's abilities are customizable, as his in-computer program earns ""build counter"" upgrades - when earning a level, Jet 0.0.0 becomes Jet 0.0.1, and so on. He acquires new abilities, and also the aforementioned weapons, in the form of ""subroutines"" held in ""archive bins"" scattered around the levels, and he has a limited number of memory slots in which to ""install"" these subroutines onto his person. Subroutines start out as alpha-grade software, but can be upgraded to beta and gold statuses, which both take up less space in memory and become more effective. The layout of Jet's memory slots changes from level to level, with immovable ""base code"" taking up various slots and limiting the number and size of the abilities Jet can equip. When attacked by viruses, subroutines can become fragmented or infected and cannot be used until Jet repairs them. If Jet encounters a program unknown to him, he can import one of its unique abilities to his own system.
As he moves through the levels, Jet must engage many lower-tier enemies. Although none are particularly powerful, they usually appear in gangs, making them more of a threat. Among the regular levels, there are some with boss enemies.
Interspersed with the first-person-shooter levels are several light cycle races. As seen in the movie, these races are actually arena duels in which each light cycle attempts to destroy its opponents by driving them into its jetwall. The arenas contain 'improvements' (such as speed zones that affect the cycles' speed), more complex layouts with walls and other artifacts (instead of the ""empty box"" as seen in the movie), and power-ups that can be collected during races. In addition to Tron's regular light cycle, Jet can also gain access to the super light cycle that sports a more modern design and offers more speed. Tron 2.0 initially required the player to win the light cycle races in order to advance the campaign. Consumer feedback revealed that many felt the computer-controlled light cyclers were impossibly precise in their controls (turning at speeds a human could not, or boxing themselves in,for example), forcing players to wait for the enemy light cycles to destroy themselves. As a result, the vendor released a patch eliminating this rule.
The additional light cycle mode contains no campaign; instead, the player is presented with a choice of several light cycle arenas.
Tron 2.0 offers some multiplayer scenarios, both in campaign mode and in light cycle mode. Internet and LAN play are available, although the vendor does not recommend that the light cycle mode be used over the Internet due to its generally high lag.

Turok: Evolution,,2002,RFX Interactive,Acclaim,"NA, PAL","The game begins with the seer, Tarkeen, explaining the history of the Lost Lands which had, for years, been fought over by tyrannic warlords.
On Earth during the old west, Tal'Set faces off with his enemy, Captain Bruckner, and succeeds in cutting off his arm, but both of them are suddenly and inexplicably sucked into a wormhole. The wormhole opens in the jungle canopy of the Lost Land, and Tal'Set is nearly killed from the fall. He is found unconscious by the people of the River Village who call upon Tarkeen to heal him. Once healed, Tal'Set enters the jungle to fight reptilian humanoids known as the Sleg, aiming to keep them away from the Village. Tal'Set and River Village pilot Genn fly upon pterosaur-back to evict the Sleg from the jungle and destroy their airship.
Tal'Set reaches Tarkeen's sanctum and is told he must accept the mantle of Turok and release Tarkeen from a curse. When Tal'Set refuses, Tarkeen tells him that the Sleg had managed to reach the Village. This enrages Tal'Set which prompts him to cut through the mountains to reach the Sleg base to free the villagers and Wise Father from captivity.
Tal'Set proceeds to liberate the prisoners and destroy the base. Here, he learns of the existence of a human general, none other than Bruckner himself, who had ordered the attack on the village. It is also learned that the Sleg are planning to assault the human capitol, Galyana, but for their army to reach it, they must cross a giant chasm with only two known crossings. Tal'Set is sent through the thickly forested Shadowed Lands to destroy one of these crossings, an ancient bridge. The bridge is destroyed with Tal'Set upon it, but he is saved from falling by his pterosaur.
Tal'Set flies to the second crossing, the Suspended City, where his pterosaur is shot down. Tal'Set breaches the city and cleanses the street with his comrades, surviving the first wave of Sleg paratroopers entering the city. He breaches the Senate and saves the Senators, who tell him that the only way to stop the Slegs from cutting through the city is to destroy it. Tal'Set subsequently releases the tethers connecting the city to the Chasm walls. Tal'Set is given another pterosaur steed by the senators and escapes the falling city by flight.
The city is successfully destroyed, but the Sleg leader, Lord Tyrannus, has one more tactic to try. He unleashes the Juggernaut, an immense pair of cannons mounted upon a massive sauropod, with the aim to level Galyana. Tal'Set infiltrates and destroys the Juggernaut but before escaping is confronted by Tyrannus. The Sleg leader threatens to kill Tal'Set but is held off by Tarkeen. Tal'Set escapes again on his pterosaur and destroys one last wave of Sleg troops.
With the Sleg defeated, Tal'Set continues his hunt for Bruckner, quickly finding him aboard a Tyrannosaurus rex equipped with various weapons. Tal'Set kills the animal, which traps Bruckner beneath it as it falls. Tal'Set leaves the villain alive, stating ""he does not deserve a warrior's death"". As Tal'Set leaves, Bruckner is eaten alive by a pack of Compsognathus. In the aftermath, Lord Tyrannus furiously screams at his defeat and was not mentioned or seen again. Tal'Set tells Tarkeen that he accepts the mantle of Turok.

After Ty returns the talisman to Rainbow Cliffs, his parents who were trapped in the alternate realm of ""The Dreaming"" during an earlier battle with Boss Cass return to the real world. Ty and his parents embrace and Rainbow Cliffs is saved. Boss Cass is later detained by police as a result of the incident.
Some time later, Cass' henchmen lead an spontaneous attack on the town of Currawong. Ty, his girfriend Shazza the Dingo, Ranger Ken the Tasmanian Devil, and Duke the Kiwi arrive to assist Maurie the Cockatoo, Sly, and the local police in containing the situation. Together with Sly and Shazza, Ty manages to fight his way into the city and halt the advancing dropships and giant Daemon Fluffy mechs using his own bipedal Battle Bunyip power suit. Cass's thorny devil henchwoman Fluffy arrives in her own Bunyip mech and makes her way towards Currawong Jail. Ty and Shazza realize that the attack on Currawong was a diversion so that Cass's henchmen could break him out of prison, and Ty gives chase. Ty manages to catch up with Fluffy, and despite being supported by several genetically-enhanced Frill Lizard henchmen, she is overpowered by Ty's Battle Bunyip. Ranger Ken and Duke arrive by helicopter to Ty's aid, but are subsequently shot down by Fluffy. Ty breaks off the fight to rescue his friends in the crashing helicopter, giving Fluffy the time to successfully break Boss Cass out of prison. After taunting Ty's efforts, Cass and Fluffy escape via a passing dropship. Frustrated by the turn of events, Ty vows to be ready for Cass when they meet again.
Two months later, Ty and his friends preside over a special inaugural ceremony, where Dennis the green tree frog announces the formation of ""Bush Rescue"", a peacekeeping organization based in Burramudgee dedicated to the protection of Southern Rivers. Ty and Shazza are then informed by Dennis that Boss Cass has founded his own country called ""Cassopolis"", and now possesses diplomatic immunity as a result of his leader status. Waiting for an opportunity to recapture Cass, Ty and the rest of Bush Rescue go on a number of missions around the Southern Rivers such as transporting valuable items and rescuing civilians. On one mission in Steele Springs, Ty has a run-in with Fluffy who sends Patchy the Cybersaur (an Ankylosaurus with robotic enhancements on its head, tail, and back) to eliminate him. Later on, while trying to stop a fire on the Wuli Wuli Oil Rig, Fluffy forces Ty to fight Buster (a giant robotic monster formed from hundreds of yellow nanobots joined together), which Ty also manages to defeat. During the battle, Fluffy manages to steal an interface device known as a Shadow Drive from the rig and delivers it to Boss Cass. Back in Cassopolis, Cass then uses the drive to power a device which combines the warm blood of a kidnapped koala worker with one of his Frill Lizard henchmen to create an ""Uber Frill"", a genetically-modified bioweapon (prototype Uber Frills had previously been used to break him out of prison).
During his rematch against Fluffy on her coastal fortress, Ty manages to steal a data module known as a Data N.U.T. and gives it to Julius for analysis. Upon analysis of the N.U.T., Cass's evil plan to capture the people of Buramudgee and use them for the mass production of Uber Frills is unveiled to Bush Rescue. Just as they learn of the plot, Cass's minions attack Bush Rescue HQ and Ty battles a group of Uber Frills; while Ty is distracted during the battle, Cass manages to kidnap most of Burramudgee's mammal population. Out of options, Ty, Sly, Shazza and Duke fly to Cass's lair to stop him, with Shazza commandeering a standard Battle Bunyip, Sly using his custom-made Missile Bunyip, and Ty using the newly-constructed Shadow Bunyip. After eliminating most of Cass's henchmen, including a rematch with Patchy and Buster, Sly and Shazza go to free the residents of Burramudgee while Ty goes to defeat Boss Cass. Just before he leaves, Ty kisses Shazza and says he'll be alright.
Ty jumps down into a hole and encounters Cass in the heart of the island's volcano. He then summons a large number of green nanobots which join together to form a long-armed robot (known as Armstrong in the GBA game) to fight Ty. After a long and difficult battle, Ty manages to destroy Armstrong and defeats Boss Cass once and for all. When they return to Buramudgee, Ty, Sly and Shazza receive medals for their bravery from Dennis and Bush Rescue, while Boss Cass is sent back to prison to carry out lunch duty for all of his imprisoned henchmen. If the player achieves 100% completion, the bunyip elder Nandu Gili appears before Ty and Shazza through astral projection, and requests that the two teleport with him to The Dreaming (called ""The Dream Time"" in-game) for them to see something. When Ty passes through the portal, he is immediately spotted by three unknown creatures.
The story of the Game Boy Advance version remains mostly the same, with certain sequences such as the opening battle with Fluffy being altered. A boss fight against a malfunctioning Cy the Cybernetic Tiger which was teased during the previous game's post-credits scene is also added, although it bears little relevance to the overall plot.
","Bush Rescue is set in Southern Rivers, a rural Australian countryside divided into many smaller areas, such as Bush Rescue HQ, the town of Burramudgee, and various other inhabited regions. Presented as a non-linear open world game, the player is given a degree of choice as to where to go and the order of what missions to accomplish[1][2][3] While most of the gameplay is on foot, the player is occasionally given a selection of vehicles and weapons to control, which include trucks, mechanical body suits known as ""Bunyips,"" mortar launchers, helicopters, and go-karts.
The game progresses by completing missions, which range from helping town citizens, delivering items from one point to another, destroying mission-critical objects, and defeating certain enemies/bosses. After completing a handful of normal missions, the player is assigned a plot-critical mission, which progresses the game further and unlocks new areas upon completion. Ty's trademark weapons are his twin boomerangs, which can be thrown individually or together to defeat enemies, be used to perform a glide after jumping or falling, manipulate objects to create or clear pathways and utilize objects for maneuvers. Ty can also use a bite attack, which lunges himself at the nearest enemy, crate, or object with a large jaw chomp. It also allows him to reach hidden areas of objects by chaining bites together (Similar to the Homing Attack in Sonic games). New boomerangs can be purchased using Opals, the game's currency, at Sly's Boomerang Shop in Burramudgee, each with varying differences in combat effectiveness and functionality.
Multiplayer consists of Mario Kartâstyle go-kart racing, where players use various items to disrupt other racers as they compete to reach the finish line. The mode is playable split-screen with up to four players (two in the PS2 version).
While the story and overall gameplay remains the same as the console versions, the Game Boy Advance version plays as a 2D side-scrolling platformer as opposed to a fully 3D game. The game also is more restrictive, changing the open world vehicle exploration found in the console versions to an overworld map with enemies scattered throughout in real-time. Interacting with the enemies on the world map triggers a driving minigame where all enemies must be destroyed before being allowed to proceed, similar to Bionic Commando. Go-cart racing and all side quests associated with it were also completely removed, and no multiplayer modes are available in this version.

Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan,,2005,Krome Studios,Activision Value,,"The events of the console and handheld versions of this game differ so greatly, the GBA release should be seen as an alternate retelling of the events in the console version.
Some time after the events of the previous game, the Bunyip Elder Nandu Gili makes contact with Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and his friend  Shazza the Dingo, telling them that an ancient evil arrived in the magical dimension of ""The Dreaming"" just as Ty's nemesis, a cassowary named Boss Cass, was being freed from Currawong Jail. Requesting their assistance, Ty and Shazza are teleported into the Dreaming by the Elder. When the two arrive, the Bunyip Elder explains that evil spirits known as the Quinkan invaded the sacred realm and tainted it with war and violence. Ty agrees to drive off the Quinkan, but the Elder claims that it would be suicidal, as the Quinkan are immune to conventional weapons such as Ty's Boomerangs. Instead, he suggests that Ty and Shazza locate and acquire the Bunyip Gauntlet, which would give Ty the means to fight the Quinkan.
After acquiring the Gauntlet, Shazza remains behind with the Bunyip Guardian Thigana while Ty proceeds deeper into the Dreaming. Using the Gauntlet and the Shadow Bunyip mech, Ty manages to open up a vortex which sucks the Quinkan out of the Dreaming. Congratulating Ty for successfully liberating the Dreaming, the Bunyip Elder offers to train Ty in how to make proper use of the Bunyip Gauntlet for the future, which he accepts. After training with Thigana and the Bunyip Gauntlet's guardian Mallyaan, The Bunyip Elder teleports Ty and Shazza back to Southern Rivers. While in the teleportation conduit, a Quinkan appears and knocks Shazza away from Ty, causing the two to become separated. Although he spends only moments in the conduit, Ty ends up arriving back in Southern Rivers six months after Shazza as a result of the incident.
Following the events of the previous game, Ty and Shazza are contacted by the Bunyip Elder, who teleports them both to The Dreaming. Once they arrive, the Elder explains that evil spirits known as the Quinkan invaded The Dreaming and began wreaking havoc across the realm. While Shazza stays behind with the Bunyip Elder, Ty is tasked with driving the Quinkan out of the Dreaming, and is teleported to the Quinkan Castle deep within the realm. Ty makes contact with Julius when he arrives, who provides him with a newly developed Vortex Bomb capable of sucking all the Quinkan out of the Dreaming. After making his way through the castle, Ty plants the bomb at the castle's weak point and activates it. While he is making his escape, Ty is teleported by the Bunyip Elder back to the real world to evade the Bomb's blast. Although he encounters Shazza while in warp transit, Ty ends up arriving in the real world several months after Shazza does due to the two becoming separated while in the conduit.
When Ty makes it back to Southern Rivers, he arrives in a desolate area overrun with Quinkan. Reuniting with Shazza and Sly, the two explain that they are currently in the town of ""New Buramudgee"", as the old town was destroyed when the Quinkan invaded Southern Rivers. The invasion also lead to the disbandment of Bush Rescue, which was unable to stop the invaders without Ty's assistance. With Ty safe and sound, the three decide to reform Bush Rescue and drive the Quinkan out of Southern Rivers. All but a few of the former Bush Rescue members rejoin the team, along with Shazza's sister Naomi as the team's new Bunyip Suit mechanic. Buramudgee resident Red the Dog also joins the team, believing that an understanding could potentially be reached with the Quinkan through negotiation rather than violence.
With Ty's help, the reformed Bush Rescue manages to liberate a large portion of Southern Rivers. Along the way, Ty manages to rescue Dennis, who had taken charge of the war effort following Bush Rescue's disbandment and had since been captured by the Quinkan, along with convincing Maurie to rejoin, himself becoming a recluse after establishing a watering hole in the mountains. After liberating the area surrounding New Buramudgee, Dennis informs Ty that a powerful Quinkan guardian known as the Hexaquin is blocking Bush Rescue's access to the other parts of Southern Rivers, and tasks Ty with defeating him. After making it to the Hexaquin's blockade, Ty battles and eventually defeats the creature, allowing Bush Rescue's safe passage through the area.
Following the battle, Ty is informed that Red had deserted Bush Rescue and kidnapped Shazza, handing her over to the Quinkan as a hostage for his own protection. Desperate, Ty and the rest of Bush Rescue reluctantly team up with Boss Cass and Fluffy, with Cass making a promise to locate Shazza in exchange for Ty completing various tasks for him. While Ty is busy completing Cass' assignments, Fluffy challenges him to a race up Whataview Mountain, with Fluffy making sure that Cass keeps his word should he win and Ty becoming her personal slave for a day if he loses. With the new Extreme Bunyip provided by Naomi, Ty achieves a narrow victory against Fluffy. Expressing that the two of them are meant for each other, Fluffy assures Ty that she'll make sure Cass keeps his word and locates Shazza for him.
Once his assignments from Cass are complete, Ty is informed by Cass that Shazza is being held hostage by another Quinkan guardian known as the Dragonquin hiding in the skyline of Cassopolis. Using the Gunyip fighter plane, Ty manages to locate the Dragonquin. He defeats the creature, freeing Shazza and causing the parts of the Dragonquin's body to turn to stone and fall into the forest below. Once freed, Shazza informs Ty that while in custody she overheard the Quinkan making preparations for their leader, the Quinking, to arrive in Southern Rivers.
Upon further research, Julius speculates that the parts of the Dragonquin's body that fell to the ground, which he dubbed Shadow Stones, could be used to power a weapon capable of defeating the Quinking. Upon Dennis' suggestion, Ty goes to see the supposed ""Quinking Expert"" in the Valley of the Lost for advice, who ends up being Gooboo Steve. He explains that the ultimate weapon capable of defeating the Quinking, the Shadowring, was lost somewhere in the forest and would not function properly even if it were found without the Shadow Stones. With this information, Ty, Julius and Ranger Ken manage find the missing Shadowring and Shadow Stones, completing the ultimate weapon.
With the Shadowring in Ty's possession, Boss Cass informs him that the guardian of the Quinking's territory, the Spiderquin, is the final hurdle between Bush Rescue and the Quinkan leader. Ty makes quick work of the guardian with the Shadowring, and flies to the Quinkan Citadel at the heart of the Quinking's territory with Sly, Shazza and Fluffy. After fighting through the Citadel, the group encounters the Quinking, who reveals that it was Boss Cass who let the Quinkan into Southern Rivers and the two had been working together the whole time. Seeking an opportunity to get revenge on Ty for his past defeats and to rule Southern Rivers unopposed, Cass appears and double crosses both Ty and the Quinking, arming himself with a rocket launcher. He fires a rocket at Ty, but it is intercepted before it can reach him by Fluffy, who sacrifices herself by jumping in front of him at the last moment.
Enraged by Fluffy's death, Ty takes on the Quinking in a final battle to decide the fate of Southern Rivers. While initially evenly matched, the Quinking is unable to overcome the power of Ty's Shadowrings. To gain the upper hand, he proceeds to transform into a larger Godzilla-like form, but Ty manages to overcome this more powerful form and defeat the Quinking after a long battle, restoring peace to Southern Rivers. Some time after the Quinkan are defeated, the lives of Ty, his friends and the residents of New Buramudgee return to normal. Boss Cass is sent back to prison for his crimes, and a statue of Fluffy is erected in the town's square in honor of her sacrifice.
","The overall gameplay remains similar to the game's predecessors, with the game's introduction of Bunyip Stones being a new addition to the series. These stones can be equipped to various boomerang chassis to change their functionality or elemental properties. The stones can be mixed and matched to make unique boomerang combinations, (such as explosive Lasorangs or Multirangs that track enemies). At first, Ty has only one boomerang chassis, and no Bunyip Stones whatsoever. However, new boomerang chassis and Bunyip Stones can be purchased using Opals, the game's currency, from various stores spread across Southern Rivers. Bunyip Stones can also be given as rewards for completing the game's various side-quests. With each boomerang chassis having a limited number of Bunyip Stone slots, the player is forced to strategize which stones they should make use of and which boomerang chassis to equip them to. Certain Bunyip Stones also cancel each other out (mostly the elemental stones [i.e.: Fire and Ice elemental stones can't be used together], and warp stones, which are incompatible with most other stones). Incompatible stones will glow red when equipped to a chassis, and will cancel each other out unless one or the other is removed. Each stone's effect can also be stacked upon itself to increase its effectiveness (two fire Bunyip Stones equipped to the same chassis have a greater effect than a single one does, for example).
Another major addition was that of a melee combat system. Unlike in previous games, many enemies are immune to damage from thrown boomerangs. Therefore, unless the player has a sufficiently powerful boomerang or a Bunyip Mech, most enemies can only be defeated by melee combat. Incorporating elements from beat 'em up-style games, melee combat consists of a 5-hit combo, a move that throws enemies up into the air, an aerial juggle combo and the bite move from previous games. Most enemies also possess a health bar that decreases as they take damage, with most taking multiple hits to defeat.
The Fourbie jeep used in the previous game for exploration of the overworld is absent, instead being replaced by a new vehicle, the ""Crabmersible"". The Crabmersible serves the same purpose as the Fourbie, albeit with included weapons and defenses for battling enemies in the overworld, as well as being able to submerge underwater. The Chopper, Go-Cart and Shadow Bunyip all make a return, and a new Bunyip known as the ""Extreme Bunyip"" is featured, replacing the auxiliary Bunyips and Battle Bunyip from the previous game. A new vehicle, in the form of a fighter plane known as the ""Gunyip"", is also introduced and used in certain missions.
Multiplayer is present and consists of Cart Racing (similar to Mario Kart) and Gunyip Dogfighting (similar to Star Fox 64, although more restrictive). Both of which are playable with up to 4 players.
A version of the game was also released for the Game Boy Advance. Like its GBA predecessor, it plays as a 2D platformer as opposed to a 3D platformer. When using the Gunyip, the game switches to a scrolling shooter (similar to Gradius), and when using the Chopper, the game becomes a top-down action game (similar mechanically to Solar Jetman). Unlike the console versions, the Go-Cart and related side-quests and characters are absent, and there are no multiplayer modes available.

Each of the 100 King Candidates (God Candidates in the Japanese version) is required to choose a junior high school student to act as their power user. The student is given a unique power and told to eliminate as many enemies as possible. The winning King Candidate will become the new King of the Celestial World and the winning student will receive the Blank Talent (Black Zai in the Japanese version), a talent that can be anything they choose.

Ultimate Spider-Man,,2005,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL","After explaining how he came to be Spider-Man, Peter Parker reveals that his and Eddie Brock's fathers worked together on finding a cure for terminal diseases, and created a black liquid substance that can envelop one's body and heal them, in addition to enhancing their strength and granting them super-human abilities. However, they were tricked into selling the ""suit"" to Trask Industries, and later died in a plane crash before they could complete work on it. Years later, Peter and Eddie reunite and discover the suit is their inheritance. After learning how his dad was tricked by Trask Industries, Spider-Man tries to take the suit and is covered by a portion of it. While it enhances his powers, the unstable suit also tries to consume him, forcing Peter to swiftly remove it. After learning of this and deducing Peter's identity as Spider-Man, Eddie's feelings of betrayal prompt him to take the rest of the suit for himself, becoming Venom.
After a fight with Peter that results in Venom's apparent death, Adrian Toomes, an employee of Bolivar Trask that witnessed their confrontation, contacts his boss to inform him of the suit's abilities. Three months later, while Peter has returned to his normal life, a still-living Eddie has been forced to feed on the life energy of civilians to prevent the suit from consuming him. One night, he attacks and defeats Wolverine to prove his superior strength. The following day, at Mary Jane Watson's pleads, Spider-Man investigates something rampaging through Queens, and discovers it to be R.H.I.N.O., a giant, rhinoceros-themed mecha suit, built by Trask Industries. He ultimately defeats R.H.I.N.O. and leaves its pilot, Alex O'Hirn, for the police. Meanwhile, Trask hires the Wild Pack, led by Silver Sable, to capture Eddie, but he defeats them as Venom and escapes.
During a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Peter senses Venom's presence nearby and defeats him. Venom is captured by Sable, who Spider-Man assumes is working for S.H.I.E.L.D., and imprisoned inside an energy cage by Trask. Forced to test the Venom suit for him, he chases and defeats Electro, while protecting Spider-Man, who was knocked unconscious by Electro when he interfered. As S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives and arrests Electro, Venom flees and Nick Fury wakes up Spider-Man, only for him to storm off after berating Fury over constantly interfering with his life. Eddie returns to Trask and informs him that he had more control over the suit in Spider-Man's presence. Remembering that Richard Parker's DNA was used as the basis of the suit, Trask concludes that Peter is Spider-Man and that getting some of his DNA will help stabilize the suit. Sable takes Eddie to track down Peter, but he transforms into Venom and escapes.
Meanwhile, the Beetle releases the Green Goblin and steals a vial containing a sample of the Sandman for his mysterious employer. After an encounter with Spider-Man, he escapes to the Latverian Embassy. Nick Fury later asks Spider-Man to infiltrate the Embassy, only for the Goblin to emerge from inside, though Spider-Man quickly subdues him, leading to his re-incarceration. Elsewhere, Venom defeats the Beetle when he attempts to collect a sample of the symbiote.
Silver Sable later kidnaps Peter and attempts to deliver him to Trask, but he escapes and fights her. Venom interferes and kidnaps Sable, forcing Spider-Man to give chase. The confrontation leaves both exhausted, allowing Sable to deliver them to Trask. While Eddie is imprisoned, Peter is injected by Toomes with a makeshift sample of the Venom suit, becoming Carnage and going on a rampage. Venom escapes and defeats Carnage, before absorbing the symbiote off Peter, which gives him full control over the suit. He then attempts to exact revenge on Trask, but Spider-Man goes to warn him, leading Trask to attempt to escape via helicopter. When Venom tries to destroy the helicopter, Spider-Man stops and defeats him.
As S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives and arrests Venom and Trask, Peter retrieves some files from the latter, revealing that the plane crash that killed Peter's parents was caused by Eddie's father trying the Venom suit on board and losing control due to their incompatibility, just like Eddie. When Peter tells Nick Fury that Eddie must see the files, he reveals that the latter escaped. Days later, Venom kills Trask in prison, while Peter vocalizes his worries about Eddie to Mary Jane, saying that he is not sure if he is scared of Eddie, or for him. Elsewhere, a partially transformed Eddie leaps from a skyscraper, turning into Venom just before he hits the ground.
","Ultimate Spider-Man is a third-person action-adventure video game, set in an open world based on Manhattan and parts of Queens. Players take on the role of Spider-Man or Venom and complete missionsâlinear scenarios with set objectivesâto progress through the story. The player starts in story-mode where they can only free roam as Spider-Man, and the game automatically switches between Spider-Man and Venom during missions. After the main story is complete, the player can switch between the two characters at any time, and free roam as Venom.
The two characters play differently from one another. Spider-Man is more agile and uses webs to travel through the city, being able to either web swing or web zip; similarly to Spider-Man 2, the player needs to be close to buildings and manually attach webs to them. Spider-Man can also use his webs during fights, immobilizing enemies for a few seconds, or grabbing and throwing them around. Once an enemy is down, the player needs to quickly web them in order to immobilize them for good, otherwise they will get up and continue attacking the player.
Venom is much more aggressive and uses his tentacles to pull himself to buildings, much like Spider-Man's web zip. He can perform massive jumps and grab enemies, whom he can either throw away, crush against the ground, or consume. While playing as Venom, players can consume non-player characters to regenerate their health; normal pedestrians usually grant the player more health than enemies. While free roaming as Venom, he will slowly lose health regardless of taking damage or not, requiring the player to often consume people to regenerate health. Venom can throw cars and go on destructive rampages, earning police attention. The more destruction Venom causes, the more police will attempt to stop him.
As the game progresses, Spider-Man and Venom will have certain ""City Goals"" to accomplish in order to continue the storyline. These consist of various side missions, such as races, combat tours, and collectibles.
The Game Boy Advance version of Ultimate Spider-Man is a side-scroller beat 'em up, divided into seven ""issues"", each containing three chapters. Both Spider-Man and Venom are playable, and each has his own series of levels. In addition to the two main characters, the game features three additional bosses: Shocker, Silver Sable, and Carnage. This version includes a limited supply of Spider-Man's web fluid, which can be refilled by picking up special markers scattered throughout levels or dropped by enemies. Additionally, players may choose to collect hidden power-ups to gain more web fluid capacity or gain moves and abilities for both Spider-Man and Venom.
The Nintendo DS version of Ultimate Spider-Man is a side-scroller beat 'em up, albeit it features a 3D environment. Both Spider-Man and Venom are playable, and each play differently from the other. In the Spider-Man levels, most of the game happens on the top screen and the touch screen is only used for selecting special attacks and operating certain objects (moving heavy objects, opening broken elevator doors, etc.). In the Venom levels, the game switches to the touch screen, and players are able to grab and throw objects or enemies using Venom's tentacles, or attack by tapping the screen. The game also features a slightly modified storyline and a multiplayer mode, where players can unlock different characters and arenas for a head-to-head fight.

W.I.T.C.H.,,2005,Climax Group,Buena Vista Games,PAL,"The game starts with Hay Lin, one of the five main protagonists, having a vision.[1] The W.I.T.C.H. Guardians Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin embark on a mission to defeat the series' antagonist, Prince Phobos.
","The game is divided into chapters, in which there are stages. Each Guardian has the ability to fly as well as two unique elemental powers. Players are able to switch between the Guardians at any time (Will is the default guardian). Players can also combine the powers of any two guardians except Will to destroy all enemies on screen.[1] However, using elemental powers and flying drains energy from the Heart of Kandrakar meter displayed at the top of the screen, above the health meter. Likewise, when characters endure damage bars from the health meter are lost. Caleb is also playable in more action-oriented levels.[2] He can use a sword and longbow. Blunk is a non-player character who trades useful items for something he wants. Needed items can be stored in the inventory. The game has 20 levels in total. After beating the game, the player unlocks Kandrakar Mode, which allows each Guardian to use her abilities without drawing power from the Power Meter and gives Caleb unlimited arrows.

Wagamama * Fairy: Mirumo de Pon! DokiDoki Memorial Panic,,2005,,Konami,JP,"The fairy protagonist is a love fairy named Mirmo (Mirumo in the Japanese version). Katie Minami (Kaede Minami in the Japanese version) is the human protagonist and a cheerful and energetic eighth-grader who is shy around her male classmates, which makes it difficult for her to date. One day, on her way home from school, she walks into a mysterious shop and buys a blue cocoa mug. When she arrives at home, she peeks into the bottom of the mug and discovers an engraved note which says, ""If you read this message aloud while pouring hot cocoa into the mug, a love fairy (""muglox"") will appear and grant your every wish."" The skeptical but curious Kaede follows the directions and announces her wish to date Dylan Yuki (Setsu Yuuki in the Japanese version), her crush. Mirmo arrives. At first she is afraid of him but later understands that he is a muglox. Kaede soon finds out that Mirmo prefers eating chocolate and creating mischief over helping Katie.
Mirumo is a prince of the muglox world. Horrified at the prospect of having to marry Rima (Rirumu in the Japanese version), his princess bride-to-be, Mirmo escaped the muglox world. Hot on his heels, however, are Rima, Yatch (Yashichi in the Japanese version) the bounty hunter, Mulu (Murumo; Mirmo's brother), and many other muglox as well. The villains of the first season are the Warumo gang, a gang of criminals who plan to overthrow the Marumo kingdom. Though they are villains, they actually aren't evil; they just pull childish pranks and faint after hearing an evil plan. At the end of the season, Akumi gives Warumo Gang a time sphere, which they play around with and accidentally smash, causing the muglox world to freeze. Mirmo, Mulu, Rima, Yatch and their partners save the muglox world by having the fairies dance in front of a magical door (which allows it to open) and having the partners find the magic time bird which flew into the door to escape being captured by them.
In this season a new transfer student named Saori comes to Katie's school. The villain Darkman, created by the darkness in human hearts, tries to resurrect himself. He influences the minds of Akumi and the Warumo gang. Session magic is introduced for two-person magic, with each person combo producing different magic. Darkman controls Saori and uses her flute to control peoples' emotions. He is then defeated by Golden Mirmo, the outcome of three person session magic. With the help of Nezumi/Rato, he is resurrected until the muglox's four-person session magic gives Saori the power to defeat Darkman. The two worlds are separated until reunited by the muglox and their partners' friendship. Saori goes to Germany to study music with Akumi as her new partner.
In this season a robot octopus, Tako, convinces the gang to look for the legendary seven crystals which are drawn out by different emotions. After all are collected, the gang faces seven trials. Mirmo must pass these tests for the crystals to unite and form a pendant. Tako steals it to save his girlfriend and his land. In the end, they succeed and Tako becomes king of crystal land.
Two new characters, Koichi and Haruka, are introduced. Koichi has a crush on Katie, and Haruka is Setsu's childhood friend who wants to be a cartoonist. Her partner Panta is a ghost muglox. Thanks to Azumi, Katie and Koichi kiss. Also, Koichi confessed to Katie after Katie had a whole day of helping him confess to his crush that she didn't know was her. Setsu starts to fall in love with Katie, and Koichi realizes that he is not right for Kaede and gives up on her. After Haruka tells Dylan she loves him, he chooses her over Katie. Haruka realizes Dylan's true love is Katie and gives up on him. Dylan tells Katie he loves her and they become a couple; Katie's wish is fulfilled. Mirmo has to leave in one hour or something terrible will happen, which the Warumo gang make so. Mirmo loses all memories of Katie and turns into a rabbit. Katie brings his memories back and he turns back to normal.

Wario Land 4|Wario Land AdvanceJP,No,2001,Nintendo Research & Development 1,Nintendo,"NA, PAL, JP, AUS","Wario is reading the newspaper when he notices an article about a mysterious pyramid found deep in the jungle. The legend related to the pyramid is that of Princess Shokora, ruler of the pyramid, who was cursed by the money-crazed Golden Diva.
Without wasting time and forgetting to take his mid-morning nap, Wario jumps into his Wario Car and drives to the pyramid. As he enters it, he finds a black cat and chases it. Doing so, he falls down a precipice and is stuck inside the pyramid.
After fighting his way through the entry passage and an early boss battle against Spoiled Rotten, Wario discovers four new passages. After completing these passages, Wario gains access to the innermost part of the pyramid, which ends up being the stronghold of Golden Diva. Wario meets the cat again, who turns out to be Princess Shokora herself.
Wario defeats Golden Diva and exits the pyramid with all his treasure. What form Shokora returns to depends on the number of treasure chests Wario had acquired from the other bosses prior as well as how quickly the Golden Diva is defeated (this can range from a brattish child, a female version of Wario, a Peach-like princess and ultimately, a superheroine-like princess). Shokora gives Wario a kiss on the cheek and ascends to the afterlife as Wario watches. After she leaves, Wario grabs his loot and celebrates by going to an all-you-can eat steak buffet.
","The gameplay of Wario Land 4 (which is generally similar to that of Wario Land II and Wario Land 3) allows for some open-endedness as well as some order of difficulty. After an Entry Passage that serves as a tutorial for the game, there are four main passages: the Emerald, Topaz, Ruby, and Sapphire Passages, in order of difficulty. The Emerald Passage is themed around nature. The Topaz Passage is themed around toys, games, and other ""playtime"" ideas. The Ruby Passage is themed around mechanics and technology. The Sapphire Passage is themed around horror and danger, prominently involving ghosts and the like. After these four main passages is the ""Final"" Golden Pyramid, which serves as a recap of these four themes and houses the Golden Passage level and the final boss.
Unlike previous entries, Wario now has a health meter that depletes when he takes damage. If Wario loses all health, he is kicked out of the stage, losing any items he had collected, and must start over.

"WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!NA|Wario Ware, Inc: Minigame ManiaPAL|Made in Wario JP",Yes,2003,Nintendo Research & Development 1,Nintendo,"NA, JP, PAL, AUS",NaN,"WarioWare's core gameplay principles revolve around the concept of ""microgames"", minigames that must be completed within a demanding time limit.[1] In a stage, microgames are presented to the player consecutively, and as the player keeps playing, the game speeds up, making microgames' time limits shorter and forcing the player to complete them faster.[2] If the player completes a microgame, the game moves onto the next one, while if the player fails a microgame, by either losing the game or running out of time, one of four lives will be deducted.[3] If the player loses all four of their lives, the game will end and the player's score (the number of microgames played) will be saved if it is one of their best three scores.[4]
At the end of a set number of microgames, the player must complete a ""boss stage""; a longer microgame without a set time limit.[5] In these microgames, the player has the opportunity to gain a life back if they have lost one.[6] Mega Microgames! has nine stages, each revolving around Wario or one of his associates in a plot scenario.[6] Each stage also has a general theme the microgames present in it pertain to, such as ""Sports"" or ""Nintendo Classics"".[4] In addition to microgames, the player is also able to gain access to additional bonus minigames to play.[7]
Mega Microgames! contains 213 microgames, split over 9 stages, each with different themes and following the story of different characters, all associates of Wario whom are contacted by him to make games for him to sell as part of his new ""game"" company.[7] The game's story is conveyed through short subtitled cutscenes before and after stages.[8] In addition to microgame stages, the player can unlock ""remix"" stages which feature microgames from past stages in it, as well as other bonus stages, which feature all microgames, but change elements like speed or microgame difficulty.[7]
The player is also able to gain access to other bonus minigames if they beat or get a high score in certain main stages. The minigames are typically variations on concepts of existing microgames from main stages, and take the form of both single-player games and multiplayer games.[8]

WarioWare: Twisted!|Mawaru Made in WarioJP,No,2005,Intelligent Systems Nintendo SPD,Nintendo,"NA, JP, AUS","One day, while Wario was playing with his Game Boy Advance, Wario becomes frustrated with a particularly hard game on it and throws the system at a wall, causing it to bounce back and hit him on the head. After his temporary rage, he notices his GBA is broken. He requests Dr. Crygor's help in mending it. Crygor, however, places it in his new invention, the Gravitator, which spits out dozens of buttonless objects similar in form factor to a Game Boy Advance. It demonstrates that in order to play, the device must be physically moved. Mona and 9-Volt arrive and toy with these new units, enjoying themselves. Wario, taking note of their reaction, decides to take advantage of these motion-sensing abilities as a selling point, and recruits his friends to design microgames based on this concept.
The rest of the game features stories of all the characters in the game, each one going to Club Sugar once their stage is complete. Wario chases a mouse that breaks his watch. Mona tries to deliver pizza while avoiding a rival restaurant. Jimmy T. and his parents play on their phones at Club Sugar. Kat and Ana encounter a troll after getting lost on a field trip. Dribble and Spitz fix their taxi and add an additional feature that allows it to travel through space. Dr. Crygor attempts to upgrade the Gravitator. Orbulon tries to figure out the password to initiate warp drive in order to escape a black hole. 9-Volt becomes friends with a new student named 18-Volt at his school.
Finally, after an accident in the Gravitator, Wario turns into a superhero persona named Wario-Man. He takes Crygor's invention and turns it into a giant robot in space. Wario's friends use Orbulon's ship to get to Wario-Man, but they blast the robot not knowing Wario was inside. After falling into the ocean, Wario shouts that everyone is fired.
","Twisted follows a similar format to its predecessor, WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!, in which players must play through a series of ""microgames""; short minigames that require the player to understand and clear its objective within a few seconds. Twisted! features unique gameplay thanks to its built-in gyro sensor, which detects the rotation of the handheld system. As such, many of the microgames require the player to physically rotate the system in order to clear. For example, players may have to empty a bin's contents, steer a plane, or guide something through a maze. Microgames become more complex as the game progresses, with later microgames sometimes requiring the player to fully rotate their system.
This game changes the scoring from the other WarioWare titles. Previously, the score was the number of games that were played, but Twisted only counts the number of games that the player won. The game features items called ""souvenirs"", which are unlocked after boss stages in story mode. Records, musical instruments, figurines, games, and many quirky items are possible to unlock.
The Twisted cartridge has a built-in gyro sensor and rumble feature (for feedback during rotation). Most of the microgames are played by rotating the entire handheld device. The gyro sensor uses a piezoelectric gyroscope developed by NEC[1] to detect angular movement.
Because the game automatically calibrates the gyro sensor when the game is turned on (and after every ""micro-game""), it works with both top-loading slots (like the Game Boy Advance) and bottom-loading slots (like all other models after the original GBA: Game Boy Advance SP, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Micro and Nintendo DS Lite). The manual states that Twisted! is not compatible with the Game Boy Player;[2] although the game loads as normal, players would have to carry and tilt the connected GameCube console and use its controller for button presses, thus it is simply not practical.

Who Wants to be a Millionaire?,,2002,Hothouse Creations,Zoo Digital Publishing,PAL,NaN,"A group of contestants on each episode play a preliminary round called ""Fastest Finger First"". All are given a question by the host and four answers which must be placed within a particular order; in the first season of the original version (1998) and the first four seasons of the Australian version (1999â2002), contestants have to answer a multiple-choice question. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music for the round begins. The contestant who answers correctly in the fastest time goes on to play the main game. In the event that no one gets the question right, another question is given; if two or more contestants answer correctly but with the same time, they are given a tie-breaker to determine who will move on. This round is only used when a new contestant is being chosen to play the main round, and can be played more than once in an episode among those remaining within the group seeking to play the main game. In celebrity editions, the round is not used; celebrities automatically take part in the main game.
Once a contestant enters the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Each features four possible answers, to which the contestant must give the correct answer. Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling more difficult questions increasing their prize fund. During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two ""safety nets"" â if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. While the first few questions are generally easy, subsequent ones might prompt the host to ask if the answer they gave is their ""final answer"" â if it is, then it is locked in and cannot be changed. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won, to which the host will ask them to confirm this as their final decision; in such cases, the host will usually ask them to state what answer they would have gone for, and reveal if it would have been correct or incorrect.
During the British original, between 1998 and 2007, the show's format required contestants to answer fifteen questions. The payout structure was as follows (questions as guaranteed levels are highlighted with a bolded text):[8]

After 2007, the format was changed, reducing the number of questions to twelve; the overall change in format was later incorporated into a number of international versions over a period of four years, including the Arabian, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Polish, Spanish, and Turkish versions. The payout structure, as a whole, was subsequently changed as a result, with the second safety net relocated to Â£50,000 at question 7 (questions as guaranteed levels are highlighted with a bolded text):[9]
When the game show was revived for British television in 2018, the format was changed a second time, reverting to the original arrangement used before 2007, but with one notable difference, in that the second safety net was made adjustable â once a contestant reached Â£1,000, the host would ask them, before giving the next question, if they wish to set the next cash prize amount as the second safety net, with this allowing them to set up as high as Â£500,000 in their game as a result.
The original US version premiered on ABC in August 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by Regis Philbin. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched in January 2000 and ran until June 2002. The syndication of the game show was conceived and debuting in September 2002. The only difference between it and the British version was that episodes were halved in length â 30 minutes, as opposed to the 60-minute length of the original version. The change meant that the preliminary round of the show was eliminated, and contestants had to pass a more conventional game show qualification test. Exceptions to this arrangement, in which it was used under the name ""Fastest Finger"" included: primetime special editions of the programme; the 2004 series that was dubbed Super Millionaire, in which the final prize was increased to $10,000,000;[10] and for the 10th anniversary special of the US edition, run during August 2009 for eleven episodes. The decision to remove this round would later occur in other international versions, including the British original before its reinstatement in the renewed series.
In 2008, the US version changed its format so that contestants were required to answer questions within a set time limit. The limit varied depending on the difficulty of the question:[11]
The clock would start immediately after a question was given and the four possible answers appeared. The clock would pause when a lifeline was used. If the clock ran out with no answer locked in, the contestant would walk away with any prize money won up to that point, unless the Double Dip lifeline had been used, in which case a failure to give a second answer was treated the same as a wrong answer. This format change was later adopted into other international versions â the British original, for example, adopted this change for episodes on 3 August 2010.[12]
On 13 September 2010, the US version adopted another significant change to its format. In this change, the game featured two rounds. The first round consisted of ten questions, in which the cash prize associated to each value, along with the category and difficulty for each question is randomised per game. As such, the difficulty of the question in this round, is not tied to the value associated to it, and a contestant does not know what amount they won unless they provide a correct answer, or choose to walk away. As part of this format, the amount of money a contestant won in this round was banked, but if they walk away before completing the round, they left with half the amount that had been banked; if they gave an incorrect answer during this round, they left with just $1,000.[13] If they answered all ten questions correctly, they then moved on to the second round, which stuck to the standard format of the game show â the remaining questions are set to general knowledge and feature cash prizes of high, non-cumulative values. The contestant can, at this point, walk away with the total amount banked from the first round; otherwise, an incorrect answer meant they left with $25,000. The format was later modified for the fourteenth season of the US version, but retained the same arrangement for the last four questions.
In 2015, the so-called ""shuffle format"" was scrapped and the show returned to a version that closely resembled the original format.[14]
In 2007, the German version modified the show's format with the inclusion of a feature called ""Risk Mode"". During the main game, contestants were given the option of choosing this feature, in which if they chose to use it, they gained the used of a fourth lifeline that allowed them to discuss a question with a member of the audience, in exchange for having no second safety net â if they got any question between the sixth and final cash prize amount wrong, they would leave with the guaranteed amount given for correctly answering five questions. This format became adopted in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Venezuela.
A different variant was used in the Taiwanese version, except without any safety nets or any option to quit; however, if they were incorrect on any question, the contestant's winnings won up to the point will be cut by half.
In November 2008, the Italian version modified the format of the show under the title ""Edizione Straordinaria"" (eng. ""Extraordinary Edition""). In this variation of the game, six contestants took part, with each taking it in turns to answer questions and build up their prize fund. Utilising the time limit format introduced in the US version, this variation on the format granted a contestant the right to pass the question on to another player, who cannot pass it on themselves, while eliminating both the option of walking away from a question, and the use of lifelines. If a contestant cannot pass on or correctly answer a question, they are eliminated, and the highest cash value they made is removed. The game ends when all contestants are eliminated or the question for the highest cash value is answered â if a contestant who answers the final question gives a correct answer, they win that prize; otherwise, the last contestant to be eliminated receives a small prize if they reach the fifth question safety net. This format was later introduced to various markets over the course of a four-year-period from 2009 to 2012, including Norway, Hungary, Spain, Vietnam,[15] Indonesia, Australia, and Chile.[16]
In 2009, Australia's version was modified to use the new Italian format, the name was also changed from ""Extraordinary Edition"" to ""Hot Seat"". In 2017, as part of new modification to the format, the game incorporated the use of the Fastest Finger First round, with the winner able to select a lifeline, out of three that the show provided. or to keep a check for a AU$1,000.
In 2013, the German version modified the show's format, which runs concurrent with the original format, where only one guaranteed level exists, at â¬1,000, and maximum prize is â¬2,000,000.
During a standard play of the game, a contestant is given a series of lifelines to aid them with questions. In the standard format, a contestant has access to three lifelines â the contents can use each only once per game, but can use more than one on a single question. The standard lifelines used in the original format of the game show include:
In the US, ""Ask the Audience"" and ""Phone a Friend"" had corporate sponsorship at different periods. The original AT&T sponsored ""Phone-a-Friend"" during the original ABC primetime show and the syndicated version's first season; the current AT&T sponsored the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, AOL sponsored ""Ask the Audience"" and allowed users of Instant Messenger to participate in the lifeline by adding the screen name MillionaireIM to their contact list. When a contestant used the lifeline during the show, users would receive an instant message with the question and the four possible answers and vote for the correct answer. The computer tallied these results alongside the results from the studio audience.[17]
Contestants pre-select multiple friends for ""Phone a Friend"". As soon as the contestant begins to play, producers alert the friends and ask them to keep their phone lines free and wait for three rings before answering.[18] On 11 January 2010, the US version eliminated the use of ""Phone a Friend"" in response to an increasing trend of contestants' friends using web search engines and other internet resources to assist them during the calls. Producers came to feel that the lifeline was giving contestants who had friends with internet access an unfair advantage; they also believed it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline: friends provided assistance based on what they knew.[19]
During recordings of the current British version, security personnel from the production office stay with contestants' friends at their homes to ensure integrity. During The People Play specials in 2012 and 2013, friends travelled to the studio and stayed backstage. When a contestant used the lifeline, the friend they called appeared on a monitor in the studio, and both the friend and contestant were able to see and communicate with each other.[20][21]
During the course of the game show's history, there were a number of unique lifeline additions in various versions of the programme:
After the contestant locks in their answer, the host still can't see what the correct answer is, so they must ask the computer to reveal the correct answer.
Out of all contestants who have played the game, relatively few have been able to win the top prize on any international version of the show. The first was John Carpenter, who won the top prize on the American version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter did not use a lifeline until the final question, using his Phone-a-Friend not for help but to call his father to tell him he was about to win the million.[25]
Other notable top-prize winners include Judith Keppel, the first winner of the original British version;[26] Kevin Olmstead from the US version, who won a progressive jackpot of $2.18Â million;[27] Martin Flood from the Australian version, who was investigated by producers after suspicions that he had cheated, much like Charles Ingram, but was later cleared;[28] Mana Ashida from the Japanese version; and Sushil Kumar from the Indian version, who is often referred to in Western media as the ""real-life Slumdog Millionaire"".[29][30][31][32][33] The latest contestant to win the top prize was David Chang of the American version on 29 November 2020, the first celebrity to do so.[34][35]

The Wild,,2006,Climax Studios,Buena Vista Games,"NA, PAL","At the Central Park Zoo, Samson the Lion tells his son Ryan stories of his adventures in the Wilds of Africa. When the zoo closes, all the animals are free to roam. Samson, Benny the squirrel who is his best friend, Bridget the giraffe who clearly not interested in Benny trying to get her to go out with him, Larry the dim-witted anaconda, and Nigel the unlucky koala compete in a turtle curling championship while Ryan visits friends. Ryan accidentally causes a stampede which heads to the game. Samson and Ryan argue and Ryan storms off before Samson can apologize. Ryan wanders into a green Intermodal container just a few moments before he gets shipped away by a truck, which the legend tells will take him to the wild. With the help of a pigeon, Hamir, Samson and Benny go after him, sneaking into a garbage disposal truck with Nigel, Larry, and Bridget; Benny is accidentally thrown overboard by Bridget. After passing through Times Square and nearly being crushed in the garbage disposal, the group encounters a pack of rabid stray dogs. Samson escapes through the sewer rather than fighting. There, they take directions to the docks from two streetwise alligator brothers, Stan and Carmine. The next morning, the four friends steal a tugboat during a hectic escape from the harbor. With help from Larry, they drive the boat and reunite with Benny, who has enlisted a flock of Canada geese to help lead the crew toward Ryan's ship. Days later, Nigel has cabin fever and, under the impression they have hit an iceberg, jumps overboard.
The boat runs aground in Africa, where all the animals in the area are being evacuated by the carriers, as a nearby volcano is about to erupt. They witness Ryan run into the jungle. Samson attempts to find him. After failing to eat a crude hyrax, it soon becomes clear that Samson has never been in the wild before, to which he forlornly confirms. The rest of the group heads back to the ship, but Samson continues to search for his son. While walking, Samson sees plants and rocks change colors. Nigel is abducted by a group of wildebeests who reside in the volcano, and their leader Kazar, pronounces him ""The Great Him,"" based on an ""omen"" he received when he was young: about to be devoured by lions, a toy koala fell from a plane and scared the lions away, saving his life. Kazar wants to change the food chain; he would rather see ""prey become predators"" and vice versa. For this, he needs to eat a lion. Bridget and Larry are also captured and held hostage.
Ryan hides up an old tree, but a gang of vultures led by Scraw and Scab attack him under orders from Kazar. The branch breaks and traps his paw. Samson hears Ryan's cries and runs to save him, scaring off the birds. The two reunite but are interrupted by a herd of wildebeests. Ryan is shocked when Samson tells him to run. The two retreat to a tree where Samson reveals the truth about his past. He was born in the circus and like Ryan, was unable to roar. Samson's volatile father disowned him and allowed him to be sent to the zoo, where he lied to avoid the humiliation. The wildebeests discover them and, in the chaos, send the tree over the cliff, with Samson still hanging on. Ryan is captured and taken to the volcano.
After a run-in with a group of female German dung beetles, Benny finds Samson and gives him the confidence to be himself, even if he is not from the wild. They find two chameleons named Cloak and Camo, who were leading Samson to the volcano and are also trying to defeat Kazar's army. Samson uses the chameleons' camouflage abilities to slip into Kazar's lair. Nigel tries his best to stall the wildebeests from cooking his friends, and eventually, Samson fights Kazar but is quickly beaten. Ryan, seeing Samson in danger, climbs onto a catapulting device and launches himself at Kazar, finally letting out a roar. With Kazar distracted, Samson manages to overpower him. Ryan tells Samson that he is happy to have him for a dad. The other wildebeests are touched by this and refuse to serve Kazar any further. Samson gains the courage he needs and roars powerfully enough to push back a charging Kazar. The group and the wildebeests flee, except for Kazar, who is trapped in the erupting volcano, in which he gets crushed to death by a falling rock. They manage to escape on the boat and travel back to New York.

Wing Commander: Prophecy,Yes,2003,Raylight Studios,Destination Software,"NA, PAL","Twelve years after the destruction of the Kilrathi homeworld, the Terran Confederation is building several Midway-class megacarriers, brainchild of Navy Commodore Christopher 'Maverick' Blair. The first one, the Midway herself, is undergoing her shakedown cruise, with Blair along for the ride.
The player takes the role of 2nd Lieutenant Lance Casey, son of the venerable Major Michael ""Iceman"" Casey from Wing Commander I. He and his best friend Max ""Maestro"" Garrett have been assigned to the Midway as members of the ship's junior Diamondback Squadron, lead by Lt. Jean ""Stiletto"" Talvert. Blair, Colonel Jacob ""Hawk"" Manley and Major Todd ""Maniac"" Marshall compete for control of the Black Widow Squadron. In charge of the Midway's two squadrons is CAG Patricia Drake, while Captain Eugene Wilford serves as her skipper. Commander Aurora Finley heads up the ""Sciences Division"", while Colonel John ""Gash"" Dekker leads the ship's contingent of Marines. Finally, Blair's old love interest Rachel Coriolis has returned as the ship's Chief Technician.
The Midway receives a distress call from a Kilrathi cruiser in the H'rekkah system, and Marshall, Manley, Casey, Talvert and Garrett are sent to investigate. Casey is placed in command of his flight; Stiletto intends to test the rookie pilot's reputation. They find the cruiser has been destroyed, and attackers come out of the nearby asteroids. In order to alert Confed HQ of the invaders, who have been codenamed Nephilim, Casey, Blair and Dekker fly out to an abandoned Confed relay station. The Nephilium have been lying in wait, and Blair is captured. Casey defends the station from attackers until reinforcements arrive.
The Midway is tasked with defending Kilrathi colonists in the T'lan Meth system. Casey finds himself on Hawk's wing several times, and learns more about his father. Once, when still a rookie aboard the TCS Tiger's Claw, Manley lost a wingman, and was a complete wreck for some time. Only one pilot volunteered to fly on his wing, and had to fight off nearly an entire squadron of Kilrathi until Hawk could get his act together. That pilot, Major Michael ""Iceman"" Casey, eventually ejected from his damaged fighter and was scooped up by the Kilrathi; the family was told instead that he was killed during a Kilrathi ambush. While Casey and Manley are assisting a wing of Kilrathi fighters, Hawk advises that they turn on them in revenge for old grievances. If Casey agrees, both he and Hawk will become hostile to the Kilrathi; if he declines, Casey and Hawk are temporarily on bad terms. The Kilrathi also withhold assistance at a later juncture if Casey attacks them. Finally, the Marines retake a captured Kilrathi starbase, on which the Nephilim held a number of human prisoners, though only one remains: Commodore Blair.
Reports filter in of a Nephilim superweapon: a plasma cannon that can destroy an entire fleet with one blast. Casey leads a raid to steal the weapon, which is subsequently grafted onto the Midway. Because of incompatibilities between Nephilim and Terran technology, the plasma gun doesn't work as intended, and Casey assists in its firing by delivering a primer charge to an enemy ship. This results in the complete annihilation of the hostile fleet. If Midway attempts to charge the weapon again, she runs a two-thirds risk of a fatal backfire.
The Midway moves on to the Kilrah system, where the Nephilim's wormhole gate is still pumping out ships. Casey leads an attack on the gate, which is controlled by seven shielded towers. Casey and Talvert escort Dekker's Marines in and then combat waves of Nephilim fighters, while the Marines land and deactivate the shields on the towers so that Casey can destroy them one by one. Blair, flying in on his own shuttle, lands at the last remaining tower and deactivates its shields. The Nephilim Warlord who kidnapped Blair is within the tower; Blair, distracted by this higher priority, doesn't escape before the explosion. Casey returns to the Midway and the Confederation as a hero. Blair is declared missing in action.
","Controls are available in two modes: basic, catering to new and casual players, and advanced, aiming to give a more realistic feeling of space combat. The two modes leverage the same flight dynamics engine, but in basic mode turning the ship around is assisting the player by coupling pitch, yaw, and roll (emulating airplane flight dynamics), while in advanced mode each axis is made independent for more complex but increased control, especially when using a HOTAS setup. There is also the possibility to temporarily disable the coupling system that assists the player in keeping thrust forward as the player pivots along the axes as if the spacecraft was an airplane: when this assisting system is disabled it is therefore possible to tilt the spacecraft using thrusters while keeping movement constant through inertia, as is realistic in space, and allowing for advanced offensive and defensive maneuvers, such as drifting sideways alongside a capital ship while shooting at it or quickly pivoting 180 degrees around and shooting at a chasing fighter.
Missions are played in sequence, and while the core scenario is constant, it is possible to fail missions and keep going forward in the game. Subsequent missions may become increasingly harder as the enemy gains an upper hand on the operational theater. As is traditional for the Wing Commander franchise, the player is placed in command of a flight of fighters, piloted by various non-player characters. Some of them may be killed during missions, resulting in a KIA in the leaderboard; however, others are plot-critical and will make use of their ejection seat to escape an exploding craft.
In between missions, the player may explore the TCS Midway, the carrier vehicle upon which they are stationed, and engage various characters in conversation.

Wolfenstein 3D,No,2002,id Software,BAM! Entertainment,"NA, PAL","Wolfenstein 3D is divided into two sets of three episodes: ""Escape from Castle Wolfenstein"", ""Operation: Eisenfaust"", and ""Die, FÃ¼hrer, Die!"" serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled The Nocturnal Missions including ""A Dark Secret"", ""Trail of the Madman"", and ""Confrontation"". The protagonist is William ""B.J."" Blazkowicz, an American spy of Polish descent, and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In ""Escape"", Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. ""Operation: Eisenfaust"" follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of undead mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in ""Die, FÃ¼hrer, Die!"" he infiltrates a bunker under the Reichstag, culminating in a battle with Adolf Hitler in a robotic suit equipped with four chain guns.
The Nocturnal Missions form a prequel storyline dealing with German plans for chemical warfare. ""A Dark Secret"" deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. ""Trail of the Madman"" takes place in Castle Erlangen, where Blazkowicz's goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in ""Confrontation"", which is set in Castle Offenbach as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.
An additional episode, titled Spear of Destiny, was released as a retail game by FormGen. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the Spear of Destiny from the Nazis after it was stolen from Versailles. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, ""Return to Danger"" and ""Ultimate Challenge"", each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to build a nuclear weapon or summon demons.
","Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter presented with rudimentary 3D graphics.[1] The game is broken up into levels, each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height.[1] Each level is themed after Nazi bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator.[2] Levelsâten in the original episodesâare grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy.[3] While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and health. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire chain gun.[2] While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.[4]
The player's health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies.[5] If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one life and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets.[2] The player begins each episode with four lives[a] and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels.[5] Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered.[3] The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.[2][3]

As such, gameplay simulates a typical game of association football, with the player controlling either an entire team or a selected player; objectives coincide with the rules of association football. Various game modes have been featured in the series, allowing for gameplay variety, including the Kick Off, Online and Offline modes. In addition to these modes, there is an editing one where the player can fix (to some extent) the series' greatest problem, poor licensing.
The Master League mode, gives the user control of a team of user's selection. Originally, the players were all generic-fictional players, however this later changed giving the user the option to change the settings and choose to play with default players. These players, such as Brazilian forward Castolo, have become cult figures to many people playing the Master League. The aim is to use these players and gain points by winning matches, cups and leagues. Using acquired points to purchase real players to join the team. Ultimately, one should end up with a team of skilled players.
From PES 3 (Winning Eleven 7), players' growth and decline curves were added, where a player's statistics may improve or decline, depending on training and age. This added a new depth to purchasing players, adding value to an up-and-coming youngster whose abilities rise dramatically and creating a trade-off if the player buys skilled but declining veterans.
Fans of the series often make ""option files"" and ""patches"" which modify all player names into those of their real life counterparts, as well as including transfers from the latest transfer window and, occasionally, altered stats of more obscure players whose in-game attributes do not precisely replicate their real life skills.
""PES Stats Database"" and ""PES Stats"" are examples of websites that are dedicated to creating accurate stats for players.[4][5] More experienced gamers often use ""patches"", editing the actual game code and modifying the graphical content to include accurate kits for unlicensed teams, new stadiums, and footballs from Nike, Inc., Puma, Umbro and Mitre, as well as more Adidas balls. Most patches also contain licensed referee kits from FIFA and the official logos of the various European leagues. These patches are technically a breach of copyright, and are often sold illegally in territories in the Middle East and Asia. Konami have become less tolerant of this kind of fan editing in recent years, and now encrypt the data pertaining to kits and player statistics in each new release. However, fan communities invariably find ways to crack this encryption, and patches still appear once this has been achieved.
Since Pro Evolution Soccer 6 onwards, there has been a separate league with 18 generic teams (Team A, Team B, Team C etc.) present, which can be edited fully. This is thought to be due to the fact that Konami failed to get the rights to the German Bundesliga, and is usually made into the Bundesliga or another league of one's preference by patch makers. However, most people use this to put their edited players into playable teams from the start instead of having to play through Master League to purchase them or alternatively edit the existing non-generic teams. This feature does not appear in the Wii version of the game (but, as stated above, the non-generic teams can be edited anyway).

Worms Blast,,2002,Fluid Studios,Ubisoft,PAL,NaN,"The gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move, but with several key differences. There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an ""arch"", allowing players to reach difficult areas.
Shooting blocks will have one of two effects:
Weapons are affected differently by other blocks.

Worms World Party,Yes,2002,Fluid Studios,Ubisoft,"NA, PAL",NaN,"Like its predecessors, Worms World Party is a side-scrolling video game involving controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate any opposing teams.[3] The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations.
The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the infamous Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to very technical combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.
The image illustrates a match between three teams of worms in a pirate-themed map. Over their heads the worms have their names and hit points. The color of the text indicates the team the worm belongs to. Each team can be customized by the player's will, including the language the worms speak and the headstone that is left when a worm dies. The worms can also be drowned, in which case no headstone is left. In the bottom of the screen the remaining time and the wind speed are shown. When the time runs out, the water level starts to raise on each turn, drowning the worms at the lowest points of the map (this is called Sudden Death). The wind speed affects some weapons. Failing to account for it may turn a missile back into the worm who launched it.
The player can play against the computer, or can play against people on the same computer or over the Internet or local area network (TCP/IP and IPX supported).
The player can set up many options and make maps one can play on prior to battle to tailor the experience. There are also single-player and multiplayer missions available to help refine the player's skills with the various weapons and utilities.

WWE Road to WrestleMania X8,,2002,Natsume,THQ,"NA, PAL",NaN,"With the limited number of buttons on the Game Boy Advance, just ""A"" and ""B"", WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 employed a simple approach to simulating wrestling moves. It has been likened to how Fire Pro Wrestling based the actions on timed button pressing and strategy.[2] The combination of a button push and a direction choice when the two wrestlers lock up would result in different wrestling moves and also allowed for moves to be reversed if the timing was right. In addition, characters could climb ropes, perform running moves and pick up weapons.[2] The gameplay was seen as an improvement over the ""button mashing"" approach of its predecessor WWF Road to WrestleMania.[2]
Reviewers did point out that the game lacked a ""Create-a-Wrestler"" feature, most likely due to the limited memory of the Game Boy Advance.[2] While the gameplay itself was improved, several reviewers noted that the Artificial Intelligence that controlled the computer opponents was easy and predictable. The AI also had problems during multi-man matches, on occasion attacking their own partner during a game.[2]

WWF Road to WrestleMania,,2001,Natsume,THQ,,NaN,"The game features both singleplayer and multiplayer game modes, with multiplayer being available through the Game Boy Advance Gamelink cable. The singleplayer game modes have a variety of match types including Exhibition, Gauntlet, Season, King of the Ring, Royal Rumble, Iron Man, and Pay Per View. Due to memory and roster limit restrictions,  the Royal Rumble game mode is limited only to a maximum of 24 participants, compared to the average of 30 in its real-life variant. The season mode is incredibly similar to career modes found in other sports and wrestling games alike, which involves the player choosing a wrestler and building their career with the end goal of reaching WrestleMania, WWE's premier event of the year. Every week the player is subjected to various matches against the other competing wrestlers on the roster.

X2: Wolverine's Revenge|X-Men 2: Wolverine's RevengePAL,,2003,Vicarious Visions,Activision,"NA, PAL","The story begins in 1968. Logan (Mark Hamill) is walking along a backstreet, when behind him come some agents from the Weapon X program. They try to capture Logan so they can take him to the Weapon X facility. Logan tries to defend himself, but he is shot with a tranquilizer dart and knocked unconscious. Logan is taken to the Facility and subjected to the adamantium bonding process. Soon after, he escapes from the experiment chamber and tries to get outside. The Professor (Don Morrow) calls him an animal, which enrages Logan and helps him escape the Professor's control. Logan tries to get to The Professor to confront him but he is stopped by Sabretooth (Fred Tatasciore). He defeats Sabretooth and he confronts The Professor while telling Dr. Abraham Cornelius (Don Morrow) and Dr. Carol Hines (Jennifer Hale) to take their leave. When Weapon X restrains him at claw-point, The Professor reveals that all Weapon X subjects were implanted with a dormant and deadly virus known as the ""Shiva Strain"" as a failsafe. The Professor also reveals that the virus would kill a normal human in one year but has no idea how long the virus would kill a human mutant.
Later in the present, Logan, who now goes by ""Wolverine"", is now a member of the X-Men and he has told Beast (Richard Portnow) what he remembers of his past. Beast tells Wolverine that the Shiva Virus has bypassed his healing factor and will kill him in two days if the cure is not found (ironically, which is on Logan's birthday). Professor X (Patrick Stewart) tells Wolverine to try to find the cure in the Weapon X Facility while Beast provides Wolverine with an implanted wristwatch telling him how much time he has left. After being flown to Edmonton by Cyclops and Jean Grey, Wolverine uses a private plane flown by a female pilot (Mayim Bialik) to get to the Weapon X Facility. However, the plane is shot down. He survives the plane crash and starts making his way towards the Weapon X facility.
Wolverine fights his way to a cavern where the spirit of the Wendigo lives. Wolverine fights with Wendigo and wins. Wendigo gets up and throws Logan out of the cavern where he lands on snow. Logan sees a Weapon X truck and jumps on it. Logan reaches the Weapon X Facility and sneaks in. On the way in, he is ambushed by a group of GIs. The sound of gunfire starts and Wolverine is surprised that he is not shot. He then sees another GI who shot down the ambushers. When Wolverine asks him why he let him live by asking ""Am I supposed to thank you, or are you just a lousy shot?"", the GI states, ""Lets just say it's not your time to die...yet."" Wolverine examines him a moment and he asks ""You're not quite human, are you?"" To which the GI states, ""You should talk."" As he walks away. After fighting through the base, he accesses a database and finds that the Weapon X scientists are at the Void (a maximum security mutant detention center that's similar to the Vault) so he makes his way there. Leaving, he is attacked by Sabretooth again. Sabretooth is defeated and grudgingly gives Wolverine the Part B of the virus cure after stating that he knew about the Shiva Virus a long time ago.
Later, Logan goes to The Void where he sees Colossus (Ted Nordblum) who lets him enter the facility after he was informed by Professor X about Logan's condition. While Logan is fighting his way on the Facility, Sabretooth comes to the Void and takes out some of its security on his way to get to the Weapon X scientists. Sabretooth then releases Alpha-Class mutants Omega Red, Magneto, and Juggernaut from their prisons. Meanwhile, Logan finds Dr. Abraham Cornelius and Dr. Carol Hines. Abraham Cornelius gives Logan the formula of Part A of the cure. Due to the Void blocking Logan's contact with Professor X, he ends up having to head outside to relay the info to him. Upon leaving, he warns Abraham Cornelius and Carol Hines that Sabretooth is also looking for them. However, when Logan reaches the roof, he is faced by Juggernaut (Fred Tatasciore). When Logan defeats him, Colossus tells Wolverine that Magneto and Omega Red were the other two Alpha-Class mutants that were freed. As Colossus drags the unconscious Juggernaut back to his cell, he points to the device that will help Logan get out. Logan destroys the Void Shield and relays the info of the Part A cure to Professor X after being told that Beast has synthesized the Part B of the Shiva Virus cure. Logan then heads out to find and defeat Magneto after Professor X detects magnetic signatures.
After Logan escapes, May Deuce (Mayim Bialik) the Mutant Hunter Boss comes to the Void to lead the Mutant Hunters into hunting down Wolverine and the other escaped mutants. While looking for Magneto, Logan is contacted by Professor X stating that the Magnetic Flux Limiter Collar on him has suppressed Magneto's magnetic powers long enough for him to become more powerful. Logan comes across a ruined highway and uses a motorcycle which he rides into a ruined town. Logan manages to find Magneto (Fred Tatasciore) in a steel mill. Logan tries to stop Magneto's moves, but he has to kill all the Mutant Hunters at the same time. Logan defeats Magneto and knocks him unconscious. Upon being told by Professor X that too much magnetic interference is preventing Rogue from homing in on him, Logan then makes his way to the city leaving Magneto for any Mutant Hunters sent from the Void.
When Logan is heading to the city to meet up with Rogue, a helicopter comes to him. In the helicopter is May Deuce. She thanks Logan because he defeated Magneto and offers to take him to the top of the Xenon Building. But when the helicopter reaches the top of a building, May Deuce throws Wolverine on the roof. Logan sees Lady Deathstrike (Gwendoline Yeo) and he realizes that the pilot, the Army GI, and May Deuce were some of Lady Deathstrike's robots who were to direct Wolverine to her so she could kill him. She also revealed that she paid Sabretooth to cause him pain. Wolverine defeats Lady Deathstrike and reaches a helicopter land platform where she follows him. Logan throws Lady Deathstrike off the roof and Rogue comes with the virus cure. Wolverine drinks it and goes home. Sabretooth finds Lady Deathstrike. He takes a vial from her and drinks it (most likely the cure for the virus), takes her, and leaves.
Meanwhile, Apocalypse (Christopher Corey Smith) and Mister Sinister (also Christopher Corey Smith) watch every move from Wolverine as they prepare their Horsemen of Apocalypse.
Wolverine lies on his bed and then suddenly realizes that he has not found and defeated Omega Red upon remembering the escaped mutants that Colossus told him about.
In all versions (except for the Game Boy Advance version) if the player collects all dog tags, a deleted scene is unlocked. As Wolverine visits a ruined town to find and defeat Magneto, he is stalked by a shadowy figure. As the figure gets close, Wolverine nearly kills the figure who is revealed to be Spider-Man (Rino Romano). When Wolverine states that Spider-Man is off his home turf, Spider-Man sarcastically explains that he heard about the big breakout down at the Void and rode a charter bus with other superheroes who could not fly or teleport. When Spider-Man asks if Wolverine needs help battling Magneto, Wolverine tells him to deal with the chaos until Damage Control arrives as he goes to battle Magneto.
","The action is played from a third-person perspective as players fight a number of armored soldiers, mutant creatures, and archenemies such as Sabretooth, Magneto, Wendigo, Lady Deathstrike, and Juggernaut. While Professor X is able to assist Wolverine with powers of telepathy, the surly comic book hero must ultimately carry out his adventure alone. To that end, players must tap into Wolverine's unique talents to overcome all manner of obstacles. Wolverine will be able to hunt and track his prey using his heightened sense of smell and ability to detect body heat. As Wolverine makes his way through the military compounds, he will need to avoid defense systems and guards, and find ways into locked rooms to discover the information he needs to survive.
When engaged in combat, Wolverine can retract and release his adamantium claws at any time to perform slashing attacks, aerial combos, and a number of different throws. The strike moves used in battle are the Combat Strike Moves, which initiate a short cut-scene where Wolverine attacks the enemy.
In addition to Combat Strikes, there are special Stealth Strikes, Situation-Specific Strikes and Boss-Specific Strikes which become available at certain points in the game. Stealth Strikes are used to take out enemies silently. For example, Wolverine can do a wall-hug to creep up on an enemy and stab him before he can sound the alarm.
Wolverine's unusual healing ability allows him to withstand punishment that would kill an average human being, but he can become wounded over time. Sustaining major injuries triggers a feral rage, imbuing Wolverine with greater strength and the ferocity to take on multiple foes at once.

X-Men: The Official Game,,2006,WayForward Technologies,Activision,"NA, PAL","During a session in the Xavier institute's Danger Room, Logan / Wolverine battles his brother, Victor Creed / Sabretooth, and ultimately ends up losing the session, though he had been saved by the timely arrival of  Iceman, who was there so that Cyclops could train him, but is too crippled with grief to do so due to Jean Grey's apparent death [N 1]. After Logan trains Iceman in the Danger Room, Professor X warns Logan against trying the Danger Room on ""Danger Level 7"" again, before asking the X-Men to return to Alkali Lake to retrieve irreplaceable parts to Cerebro. Nightcrawler infiltrates the remnants of William Stryker's base with his teleportation ability, since the weapons systems were somehow operational. Once inside, the X-Men discover a group of agents called HYDRA looting the base. Nightcrawler and Colossus go to find the Cerebro parts while Logan and Storm investigate HYDRA's presence. Logan and Storm discover that Stryker had been building giant robots called Sentinels as another plan to eradicate mutantkind.
Storm is abducted by Lady Deathstrike and Logan pursues her, eventually rescuing Storm. Nightcrawler is plagued by visions of Jason Stryker, who reminds Kurt he left him to die. Nightcrawler retrieves the Cerebro parts, battling a Sentinel in the process. A massive Sentinel - the Master Mold is activated and rises from Alkali Lake. The X-Men and Lady Deathstrike escape; Logan attaches himself to Deathstrike's helicopter to follow her while the other X-Men return to the institute.
Iceman stops Pyro from triggering a meltdown at a nuclear power plant while Storm and Nightcrawler stop Multiple Man from blowing up a bridge [N 2]. Meanwhile, Logan follows Deathstrike and her HYDRA agents to Tokyo. Logan learns that Deathstrike and HYDRA are working for the Silver Samurai. After battling though legions of HYDRA forces and ""killing"" Deathstrike again, Logan confronts Silver Samurai. Samurai reveals that HYDRA helped Stryker build the Sentinels, not realizing he planned to turn them against mutants. Silver Samurai himself is a mutant, and the Master Mold's activation was a mistake. After defeating Silver Samurai, Logan learns that HYDRA has a device in Hong Kong that can stop the Master Mold, where the Master Mold is currently heading. Logan informs Professor Xavier, who contacts Magneto - fearing the X-Men cannot stop the Sentinels alone. Magneto and Sabretooth travel to Hong Kong to help the X-Men. Xavier also reveals that Jason Stryker is still alive; his psyche now fractured into two halves: a good half who has been appearing to Nightcrawler and an evil half that is controlling the Master Mold. He states that another of his students had a similar problem (referring to Jean Grey/Phoenix).
The X-Jet is shot down by Sentinels upon its arrival in Hong Kong. Iceman battles Sentinels and recovers HYDRA's device. Magneto arrives and uses the device to incapacitate the Master Mold, which crashes to the ground, but his helmet is knocked off of his head and Magneto is subdued by Jason's telepathic powers.
Nightcrawler disables the Master Mold's control center, guided by Jason's good half, who helps point the way through the maze of the Mold's body. Nightcrawler disables the Master Mold's neural net, changed by Jason to look like a demonic realm. Meanwhile, Iceman destroys the core of the Master Mold and Logan - in another of Jason's hallucinations - fights several feral clones of himself, emerging victorious. Nightcrawler attempts to save Jason as the Master Mold begins to collapse, but Sabretooth abducts Jason and attempts to make his escape. Logan tracks Sabretooth's scent and confronts him while Kurt escapes with Jason. The two have a vicious battle, ending with Logan throwing Sabretooth from a great height to be impaled below. Jason dies, thanking Nightcrawler for saving him. Magneto leaves, vowing that his next encounter with the X-Men will be as an enemy.
Back at Xavier's mansion, Nightcrawler tells Xavier he does not want to be an X-Man, for their lives are too violent and he is a peaceful man. Xavier tells him he is always welcome in the Mansion, and Kurt leaves [N 3]. Meanwhile, Cyclops goes to Jean Grey's house and sees her, apparently still alive, with her power spiraling out of control, resulting in her shutting the door on him. The game ends with Cyclops begging to be let inside[N 4].
","Players control the actions of several X-Men-related characters, most notably Logan, Nightcrawler and Iceman, as they uncover a plot to eradicate mutants. Sometimes, another X-Man will help the player's character battle. The Nintendo DS game features Magneto as a playable character, while the Game Boy Advance version features Colossus as a playable character. Many agree that Logan is the only useful character in the Game Boy Advance game, which allows players to cycle through characters at will, as he is the only one who can recover from damage.

Yggdra Union: We'll Never Fight Alone,No,2006,Sting Entertainment,Atlus,"NA, JP, PAL","The story of Yggdra Union starts with the Princess of Fantasinia, Yggdra, fleeing her besieged home with the family heirloom, the Holy Sword Gran Centurio. Throughout the story, the idea that justice lies with the Holy Sword[1] is used to drive Yggdra and her army forward through their plight, as well as to provide explanation to them for the acts they commit. It is constantly used as justification for their acts, particularly those situations in which civilians are slaughtered during the war.
The story mainly details Yggdra's reclamation of her kingdom from the Bronquian Empire, and her eventual uniting of the entire world under her sovereignty, with quite a few stops along the way leading to an intricate and involving plot. The ending is split off based on the player's actions, one ending essentially being a game over and the other two being open ended with Yggdra either pursuing the ideal that justice lies with the holy sword, or sacrificing it to achieve universal peace.
In the PSP version, additions were made to the story that further develop the Dept. Heaven universe and story, deeply tying the game into mythological elements first developed by Riviera, with the more direct appearance of Diviners, and Grim Angels, and passing mention of Malice, Hector and The Seven Magi. With the events of Yggdra Union's PSP ending where the Royal Army attack Ragnarok, this is now cemented into the canon storyline, marking Yggdra Union as a prequel to Riviera: The Promised Land.
Yggdra Union features a large cast of characters, the most important of which is the seventeen-year-old[2] princess, Yggdra Yuril Artwaltz,[3] whose plight is the center of the story. The lead male of the story is Milanor, the seventeen-year-old[2] thief king; The Silver Wolf, whose home was burned down by the Empire in an attempt to find Yggdra. These two start and lead the Royal Army to take back the Kingdom from the Empire. One ally they recruit is Durant, the twenty-four-year-old[2] leader of the Third Cavalry,[4] a knight of Paltina. Nietzsche, the twelve-year-old,[2] naÃ¯ve Undine from Embellia joins the Royal Army to gain revenge on the Empire for their espionage in her country, as well as to search for the Transmigragem. Twenty-one-year-old[2] Necromancer Roswell of the Branthese house and nineteen-year-old[2] Witch Rosary of the Esmeralda house are met in Verlaine Hills, one of which will join the Royal Army for revenge on the Empire's involvement and betrayal in Verlaine and to recover the Ankhs, the other of which will die at the hands of the Royal Army. Kylier is a seventeen-year-old[2] Griffon Rider from Lost Aries, with an affection for Milanor, who never really joins the Royal Army, but assists them when they need help most. She rides her Griffon Al into battle. The Astral Fencer, the twenty-five-year-old[2] Russell betrays the Empire and joins the Royal Army for revenge for his fiancÃ©e Flone, and to repay the Royal Army for his actions against them. Cruz is a twenty-two-year-old[2] hunter, who made it to number one on the Empire's Most Wanted List for his leadership of the Karona Resistance and joins the Royal Army after his headquarters is tracked down and attacked by Mizer. Elena is the sixteen-year-old[2] Assassin that joined the Empire for a chance to stop her brother, Leon, to restore honor to her family,[4] and when her betrayal becomes clear, and the Royal Army aids her, she joins to repay her debt to them. Gordon, of the Temple Knights of Welheim is another ally to the Royal Army, albeit only for a short time. He joins when the Royal Army offers assistance in saving the Pope.
The Empire contains many characters, too, starting with the twenty-year-old[2] Bronquian Emperor, Gulcasa. A descendant of Brongaa, and seeker of his resurrection, Gulcasa took the Empire in a violent coup d'Ã©tat, and immediately began conquering neighboring countries. Despite his violence, he has full support of the Bronquian people. His direct subordinates, the eighteen-year-old[5] Twin Valkyries Aegina Eine Artwaltz and Luciana Rune Artwaltz, apparently of Royal lineage, make constant attempts on the Royal Army, Yggdra in particular. Leon is the first introduced of the five Dragon Generals, twenty-two-year-old[5] brother to Elena, he is called the Black Knight for his excessively wanton violence and cruelty. Emilia, a Dragon General titled the Scarlet Princess, is half-sister to Gulcasa through a shared father.[4] She abhors being labeled a child, and will do anything to defend Bronquia. Baldus, the Dragon General known as the God of War, is an older, wiser, yet extremely powerful warrior of Ishnad. The last of the Dragon Generals is Nessiah, the Imperial Army's war strategist, truthfully a Fallen Angel igniting wars to enrich the Gran Centurio with which to take revenge on the Gods. Eudy, the twenty-eight-year-old[5] Court Magician, is another high ranking general in the Imperial army, and the cause of many cannon woes.[4]
The game features many more characters, both enemy and otherwise that further delineate the story and lengthen the quest. The PSP version added a few new characters, including an elderly man named Bly, a woman named Mistel, and an angelic figure referred to simply as #367. The PSP version added also full voice acting, with notable talents including Mai Nakahara as Yggdra, Miyuki Sawashiro (ã¿ãã) as Milanor, Yui Sakakibara as Kylier, Atsushi Kisaichi as Durant, Ai Maeda as Nietzsche, Akemi SatÅ as Rosary, Ai Nonaka as Emilia and Mariko Suzuki as Zilva.
","The game follows a linear succession of battles. Within each battle, units are displayed on a grid of spaces which decide where the characters can move. The player and the computer take turns in which movements are determined and one attack can be executed against an opposing character. The player may choose to end his/her turn at any time. Unions are the eponymous game play mechanic. Unlike most games, the player is allowed one attack per turn. Attacks are performed in formations called unions. Most unions involve multiple units, but it is possible to attack with a ""union"" of one unit. Forming unions allows more than one unit to join the battle, allowing for battles between as many as eighty soldiers, grouped into up to five individual battles between two units named 'clashes'. Depending on the gender of the unit, the formation required for a union will be different. Males have an x-shaped formation, whereas females have a plus-shaped formation. Linked unions, which become available during the fifteenth battlefield, allow units within the core union to apply their union pattern to extend the overall union.[citation needed]
Each unit that can be included in a union is composed of a leader, the head, and as many as seven underlings, or 'members'. For example, in the case of Yggdra's unit, Yggdra is the head, and her five members are Sword Maidens. Each unit has a weapon type, with strengths and weaknesses in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. Each unit comes with six stats: Morale, an indicator with a function similar to Hit points; GEN, generalcy; ATK, attack; TEC, technique; and LUK, luck. The final stat depends on alignment of the unit. Player units have REP, reputation, measuring victory rates, and enemy units have POW.UP, which is a reducible stat that increases card POW upon player victory. Each unit also has the potential for five 'effects', which are strategy altering hooks that do many things, from the in-clash voiding of damage enhanced with a particular element, to out of clash Morale restoration. Up to four effects can be innate to the unit, with one effect coming from the unit's equipped item. Items are multi-purpose in Yggdra Union; they can be equipped for stat ups and effects, or they can be consumed to recover Morale. Equipped items cannot be removed, and will disappear after a set amount of battlefields.
Players choose a card at the beginning of each turn. Each card also has a skill, ranging in effect from restoring allies and killing enemies, to changing the landscape and even invincibility. Each card has three attributesâpower, ace, and movement:

When Bowser starts wreaking havoc on Yoshi's Island, a book spirit named Hongo traps the entire island within the pages of a storybook. Only by locking Bowser away, Yoshi can convince Hongo to release the rest of the island, so he sets out to progress through the chapters of the book.
","Each course is controlled by a spirit, each with an obsession â one loves money, one loves fast things, one loves friendliness, one loves strength, etc. They will set out guidelines for the course, such as collecting fruit to free a certain number of Egglings, finishing a course before time runs out, finding a certain number of coins or defeating â or not defeating â a certain number of enemies. By satisfying that spirit's requirements, players pass the course.
Yoshi can jump and stick out his tongue to eat fruit or enemies, but the main feature of the game is the tilt mechanism. By moving the Game Boy Advance side to side, players tilt the world around Yoshi, causing enemies to roll around, swinging ships and pendulums, and bouncing items all over the place. An impassable wall will become a climbable slope, or a rolled-up carpet will become a long platform. Each environment requires players to master not only button presses but also tilt movements to progress.

One day, he solves an ancient puzzle known as the Millennium Puzzle (åå¹´ããºã«, Sennen Pazuru), causing his body to play host to a mysterious spirit with the personality of a gambler. From that moment onwards, whenever Yugi or one of his friends is threatened by those with darkness in their hearts, this other Yugi shows himself and challenges them to dangerous Shadow Games (éã®ã²ã¼ã , Yami no GÄmu, lit. ""Games of Darkness"") which reveal the true nature of someone's heart, the losers of these contests often being subjected to a dark punishment called a Penalty Game (ç½°ã²ã¼ã , Batsu GÄmu). Whether it be cards, dice, or role-playing board games, he will take on challenges from anyone, anywhere. As the series progresses, Yugi and his friends learn that this person inside of his puzzle is actually the spirit of a nameless Pharaoh from Ancient Egyptian times, who had lost his memories. As Yugi and his companions attempt to help the Pharaoh regain his memories, they find themselves going through many trials as they wager their lives facing off against gamers that wield the mysterious Millennium Items (åå¹´ã¢ã¤ãã , Sennen Aitemu) and the dark power of the Shadow Games.[2]

They resemble the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories, themselves based on the prototype rules that were being considered when the card game was first being transferred over from the manga. Unlike the real game, there is an elemental ruling. For example, water beats fire, electricity beats water.[1] Also, there is a notable absence of game phases and numerous card effects have been removed or changed.

Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004|Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Expert 3JP,,2004,Konami,Konami,"NA, PAL, JP",NaN,"This game has many obvious similarities to The Eternal Duelist Soul. The duel system is almost exactly the same, but there are a few differences.
The player can assemble a deck and can duel against a variety of computer opponents. The game features the first 1,138 cards released in Japan. There are 29 opponents in the game, however duelist 29 can't be played and is locked when Marik is at least once defeated. Each opponent has different skills and decks revolve around a certain theme (Yugi=Basic, Exodia Rare Hunter=Exodia, Yami Yugi (Dark Yugi)=Ultimate, etc.).[1]
When a duelist has at least one copy of all 1,138 cards, they can choose to ignore the Limited List. However, the stronger duelists don't follow the Limited list either. For example, Simon the Exodia duelist has three of each of the Exodia parts in his deck, where normally a player may only have one. The AI is rather poor: if a player has a face-down monster with 2000 defense points, and the AI opponent has a monster with 1900 attack points, they will not attack as they ""know"" they cannot defeat the face-down monster. As well, an AI opponent will Tribute Summon as soon as possible, even tributing 1 monster to summon exactly the same monster, or even a weaker monster than the original. Stronger duelists often have high requirements to be ""unlocked"" (available to duel): the final duelists in the game require the player have at least fifteen more wins than losses against every other duelist in the game.

Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel,,2003,KCEJ,Konami,"NA, PAL, JP","With a vague plot many different challenges are available, but the significant part of the game is ""The Pyramid"". Once the five Ghouls are defeated, TÃ©a, controlled by Marik Ishtar, will lead you to the Pyramid.  The Pyramid is a five-game gauntlet challenge in which a player who loses must restart from the beginning. The Pyramid is organized into chambers. The first duel is against TÃ©a controlled by Marik; the second and third duels are against 2 of the 5 ghouls at random. The fourth duel is against Joey Wheeler controlled by Marik; in the 5th and final chamber, the opponent is Marik himself.  Upon Marik's defeat, the Pyramid is cleared.
Once the Pyramid is beaten, the Ghouls will appear as regular opponents, and ten Card Limitation Duel events will be available.  Upon completion, the player will unlock 'Free Mode', receiving the ability to toggle on or off the deck count limit of individual cards (e.g. the trap card Mirror Force normally is limited to one copy per deck; in Free Mode, up to three copies can be used in a deck, as is the case with most other cards).  Side challenges, including ""Target Week"" and weekend championship tournaments, provide various incentives for players to seek out specific opponents throughout the game.
","The game starts out after the title screen, with one of the officials in the Battle City region, giving the player an option of 1 of 3 decks of 40 or more cards. Once a deck is selected, there is a Battle City map of characters that can be played, and can select an area of Battle City that holds up to three duelers per area.[1] However, the opponents are random, not showing a name or picture to identify their character.
The player must win, lose or tie to show all the characters at the beginning. From there, players go around Battle City to duel opponents. However, there are many events during the game to accomplish.

Zapper,Yes (SPM),2002,Blitz Games / Atomic Planet Entertainment,Infogrames,"NA, PAL","During a squabble over television, Zapper tries to use his brother Zipper (a grub) as a substitute TV antenna. Zipper is snatched away by an infamous thieving magpie, Maggie, who leaves an egg at the scene of the crime. Unfortunately, much to his dismay, Zapper sets off and determines to rescue his brother and turn Maggie into a jailbird. At the end of the game, Zapper gets Zipper back after defeating Maggie, and finally sets him up as a substitute TV antenna, just in time to watch TV by himself.
","The player's aim is to traverse over seventeen levels as Zapper the cricket. Along the way the player must collect six eggs in each level. The player can jump or zap through the levels. If Zapper touches an enemy or falls into an environmental hazard, Zapper will lose his life and will respawn at the last collected egg checkpoint. Zapper has turn-based enemy movements, but the gameplay is similar to Frogger, which instead has vehicles moving independently. It is described in the GameSpot review as ""basically just Frogger without the license"".[2]

ZooCube,Yes,2002,"PuzzleKings, Graphic State",Acclaim,"NA, PAL","A mad scientist named Dr. Buc Ooze has been conducting ""controversial research into animal shaping"" and has left many animals misshapen or in otherwise unnatural forms. In response, a machine called the ""ZooCube"" is created which reverses the effects Dr. Ooze's experiments. The player, named ""Aon"", is tasked with rescuing all the trapped animals, traveling aboard a ""flying ark"" and armed with the ""ZooCube"".[2][3]
","In ZooCube, players score points by matching animal heads that fall towards the faces of a rotatable cube. The player also needs to make matches quickly so that heads don't build up too much on the cube which can cause the player to lose, in a similar fashion to Tetris. Along the way, the player can acquire power-ups which can help the player in various way or hinder an opponent in multiplayer mode.[1]

Zooo: Action Puzzle Game|Minna no Soft Series: ZoooJP,,2003JP2005PAL,"Buddiez, Inc.",SuccessJPIgnition EntertainmentPAL,"PAL, JP",NaN,"The objective of Zoo Keeper is to remove the animal tiles that fill up the screen by aligning three or more in a row or column.[4] Levels end when a pre-determined number of each animal tile has been removed.  These quotas are listed underneath each animal symbol.
Tiles are aligned by swapping ones adjacent to each other.  If this causes a line of three or more matching tiles to form, the tiles stay in their new position and the matching tiles are removed.  If no line of three or more matching tiles is formed the tiles revert to their original position. Lines can be horizontal or vertical, and combinations can cause many lines to disappear at the same time.  When tiles disappear, any tiles above them on the screen fall down to fill the space. If this results in a further line of three, this line also disappears.  This is called a 'chain'.  An example of a chain can be seen in the screenshot: making a line of (green) crocodiles in the centre of the screen will cause the crocodiles to disappear, and the (red) gorillas will meet to make a line of three.
One very important aspect that sets Zoo Keeper apart from Bejeweled and its many clones is the ability to switch tiles while another move is still 'in progress'. This allows the player to set up chains, or to 'fake' chains by creating multiple rows of three in quick succession. Although the game registers a maximum of five tiles in a row, the player can get six, seven, or eight in a row in Zoo Keeper.
If no moves are available the screen is reset, but the clock keeps ticking.  Similarly, while chains are formed after a level is cleared the clock continues, though the player is locked out from playing. A key challenge when playing Zoo Keeper is the inability to find a valid move, which players know must exist (otherwise the screen would be reset). To combat this, players can use the ""binoculars"" tool to show the position of any unmade moves.[5]
At any time during the game, a Special Panel may appear. This is a tile which quickly flicks through all animal types giving it a flashing effect. Tapping on this tile will cause it to stop on one of the animals and all tiles of this type will be instantly removed from the screen.[5] A very rare phenomenon is where a row of three Special Panels is made. The result is a rainbow-like animation of the tiles and the word 'Revolution' appearing on the screen. 1,000,000 bonus points are rewarded when this happens.
On the DS version of the game, as shown in the screenshot, the upper screen shows a favourite animal,[6] for which captures generate increased points. It utilises touch screen operation and the opportunity to battle another DS owner. Other versions allow two players to play at once on one screen.
